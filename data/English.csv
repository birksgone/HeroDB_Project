Stronger enemy Heroes are worth more points when defeated. You get bonus points for defeating all the Heroes of an enemy team. Won points are never taken away, even if the player leaves the Alliance.

To participate in Wars you must setup a [#!]War Defense Team[#] during the [#!]Preparation Phase[#] before the War. You can not edit your Defense Team once a War has started.

You can attack multiple times in a War. Each attack consumes [#!]Alliance War Energy[#]. You get additional Alliance War Energy during the War.

Completely defeated Defense Teams are revived after a certain time, which increases on every defeat. You can attack enemies even if all the Heroes of your Defense Team have been defeated.

Note that you can only attack once with any specific Hero during the War. Having a large roster of powerful Heroes, and using them smartly, is the key to victory in Alliance Wars!"

events.rules.alliance,"The goal of an [#!]Alliance Quest[#] is to get a high Alliance Quest Score. Alliances with the highest Alliance Quest Scores win exclusive loot at the end of the event.

[#!]Alliance Quest Score[#] is the combined score of all players in all stages and Difficulty Tiers. Stages can be replayed for the best possible score.

The score from each stage is defined by the enemies defeated, speed of completion and the amount of Hero health left at the end of a stage. Big combos and great matches are also taken into account. Using [#!]Continues[#] has a negative effect on the stage score.

The different [#!]Difficulty Tiers[#] have limits on what Heroes, Troops and Battle Items can be used in the fights. In Alliance Quests, the harder [#!]Difficulty Tiers[#] are [#!]unlocked with the Alliance Quest Score[#].

[#!]Epic Difficulty Tier unlocks with:[#]
{0} Alliance Quest Score

[#!]Legendary Difficulty Tier unlocks with:[#]
{1} Alliance Quest Score

Only the Alliance members that joined the Alliance before the Alliance Quest started can participate."
events.rules.challenge,"The goal of a [#!]Challenge Event[#] is to get a high master score. The players with the highest master scores win exclusive loot at the end of the event.

[#!]Master Score[#] is the combined score of all stages within a difficulty tier. Each difficulty tier has a separate master score. Stages can be replayed for the best possible score.

The score from each stage is defined by the enemies defeated, speed of completion and the amount of Hero health left at the end of a stage. Big combos and great matches are also taken into account. Using [#!]Continues[#] has a negative effect on the stage score. It is possible that [#!]Special Enemies[#] spawn in stages. Defeating these enemies gives bonus points and awards [#!]Challenge Coins[#].

The different [#!]Difficulty Tiers[#] have limits on what Heroes, Troops and Battle Items can be used in the fights.

TIPS:

1. Using [#!]Battle Items[#] can be extremely effective in Challenge Events.

2. Some enemies in Challenge Events have an [#!]Elemental Barrier[#]. These enemies reflect all damage back from their own element.

3. Completing a difficulty tier for the first time gives a  [#!]Challenge Event Chest [#] that is not tied to the score."

hexmap.info.message,"[%140][##elementpurple]Basics[#][%]
The goal of [#!]Monster Island[#] is to earn points for your Alliance. 

This is done by 
[*] Exploring the Island 
[*] Defeating monsters (Hordes and Apex)
[*] Opening Chests (Relic and Treasure chests)

When the event timer runs out, the Alliance will receive rewards based on the amount of Chests opened and the Alliance Score rank on the leaderboard. (Please note that the rewards might change before the official release.)

Alliances are assigned an event difficulty based on their [#!]Titan[#] performance. Each difficulty has a different leaderboard and the value of rewards increase with higher difficulties.

[%140][##elementpurple]Campsite[#][%]
You begin your adventure from the [#!]Campsite[#] Area. You can edit your Team and Items only in the Campsite Area. Items consumed in battles are refilled when returning to a Campsite.

[%140][##elementpurple]Energy[#][%]
Moving and attacking enemies consumes [#!]Monster Island Energy[#]. Attacking the same enemy has an increased Energy cost. Energy is replenished by [#!]{0}[#] in fixed intervals.

[%140][##elementpurple]Monsters[#][%]
On Monster Island you can engage in two different types of battles:

[*] [#ff6666]Apex Monsters[#]: Powerful monsters with a large amount of Health. Damage done to them persists between attacks. Apex Monsters only drop Treasure chest keys.

[*] [#ffaa66]Monster Hordes[#]: Battle against a Horde of multiple monsters. Several attacks are needed to defeat all enemies. How fast each Horde is defeated will affect scoring. After a Horde is defeated, another one will take its place after a certain period of time. Hordes have higher chance of dropping Relic chest keys.

[%140][##elementpurple]Chests[#][%]
There are many secret treasures to be found on Monster Island. Find Chests on the map to boost your Heroes and unlock rewards.

There are two types of Chests:

[*] [#66ff66]Treasure Chests[#] contain loot that will be randomly distributed to all members of your Alliance at the end of the event.

[*] [#ffff00]Relic Chests[#] contain Relics that buff all your Alliance members' Heroes.

Chests are unlocked with [#!]Treasure and Relic Chest Keys[#]. All Apex Monsters and some Monster Hordes drop Chest Keys when defeated. Collected Keys are shared with the whole Alliance and anyone can use them to unlock chests.

[%140][##elementpurple]Event Battle Rules[#][%]
{1}

[##elementred]Increased Damage Against Minions: [#]
Monsters deal more damage against Heroes that have Minions.

[##elementred]Adjusted Boosted Healing[#]:
All [#!]boosted healing[#] is received as [#!]normal healing[#] in the event. Heroes' Health cannot exceed their maximum Health.

[%140][##elementpurple]Event Bonuses[#][%]
Heroes of the [#!]Plains Hunter[#], [#!]Abyss Hunter[#], and [#!]Jungle Hunter[#] families receive a [#!]Monster Island Bonus[#] in the Monster Island event! The Heroes receive [#!]increased attack, defense and health[#] as well as a [#!]reduction to the amount of permanent damage[#] they receive in battles. Their Special Skills also become empowered, casting an [#!]extra ailment[#] to all enemies.

Exploring the island wisely, buffing your Alliance with relics and having a large roster of powerful Heroes is the key to success on Monster Island!

In Raid battles your attack team will challenge an opposing player's defense team. 

[#!]Raid battles follow most normal gameplay rules[#]:

[*]Damage you deal with tile matches (troop damage) is stronger when you have elemental advantage.

[*]Troop damage increases if you have more heroes of the matched element on your team. 

[#!]Raid battles also have extra rules[#]:

[*]Troop damage gains an additional [#!]strong damage bonus[#] against the weak element. 

[*]However, this additional Raid-specific bonus decreases slightly if you have more heroes of the same element in your team. 

[*]Troop damage always has a chance to deal [#!]a critical hit[#]. Critical chance can be increased by status effects and other means.

[*]In addition to dealing more damage, [#!]troop critical hits also decrease the target's max health[#], making them easier to defeat.

After each attack, both players' [#!]Trophies[#] will change depending on their Trophy difference and their teams' performance."

raids.tournament.rules,"Raid Tournaments are Raids with Special Rules that change every week. You will receive rewards based on your raiding skills.


[#ffffff]PREPARATION PHASE[#]

The Preparation Phase lasts for one day. During the Preparation Phase you prepare your Defense Team. The Defense Team cannot be changed after the Preparation Phase has ended.

You will receive Defense Points at the end of each Battle Day. The amount of points depends on the performance of your Defense Team. You can only use Defense Teams that match the Tournament rules.


[#ffffff]BATTLE PHASE[#]

The Battle Phase lasts for 5 days. You have 5 attacks each day. Each opponent has a Difficulty Bonus that is determined based on the performance of their Defense Team compared to your previous attacks. You can only use Attack Teams that match the Tournament rules.

If your attacks result in a Defeat for 4 times, you are Defeated and cannot continue in this Raid Tournament. You can use Gems to reset your Defeats and continue. Your Defense Team will still get Defense Points even after you have been Defeated.


[#ffffff]LOOT[#]

Your final Score determines your Loot Tier. You get rewards only from the highest Loot Tier that you belong to. The reward Loot is given shortly after the Battle Phase ends."

story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.end.00,Delightful! I did not expect your choice of blades to match up so well against the rapier and main-gauche.
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.end.01,My horizons have certainly widened. It was a rare pleasure to face off against such a foreign style.
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.end.02,"Same on my end. It's not every day I get to match blades with blades, and you four are definitely no pushovers."
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.end.03,"I guess hammers aren't in fashion in these parts! A bit disappointing, that."
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.end.04,"You'd be hard-pressed to find one of that shape and size. A halberd, perhaps; but a hammer, probably not."
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.end.05,"I am loathe to cut this meeting short, but friends, we must not tarry. That diabolical villainess is still on the loose."
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.end.06,"Understood. Please excuse our haste. If we are to meet again in the future, let us duel once more — amiably."
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.end.07,"Farewell, valiant travellers! May our paths — and blades — cross again!"
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.start.00,"Halt, strangers! Sheathe your weapons and declare your affiliation."
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.start.01,"Um, sorry? Who are you people?"
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.start.02,Are you not aware of where you are passing through? Surely you are not feigning ignorance of the musketeers?
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.start.03,"Sorry, we're just travellers. And no, that name doesn't really ring a bell."
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.start.04,"Outrageous. Friends, I daresay these two so-called travellers are far too suspicious and well-armed to just let by."
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.start.05,Let us swiftly disarm and dispose of these scoundrels. We have little time to spare in our pursuit of Milady.
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.start.06,All for one —
story.questline.alliancequestmusketeers.start.07,— and one for all!
story.questline.ancientdragon.end.00,"Well fought, Commander!"

story.questline.astralelves.start.01,"Hello humans! I am Starwalker, king of the Astral Elves."
story.questline.astralelves.start.02,Gaze upon the plane where galaxies sleep.
story.questline.astralelves.start.03,It is rare to receive humans as visitors.
story.questline.astralelves.start.04,You must have great power to have found the astral plane.
story.questline.astralelves.start.05,"As a matter of fact, I would like to test your power. Care for a friendly challenge?"
story.questline.astralelves.start.06,"How about it Richard? If you were to face the king of the Astral Elves, would you lose?"
story.questline.astralelves.start.07,"Nah, I would win."
story.questline.battle_item.end.00,"Yeah, these should help us in oncoming battles."

story.questline.battle_item_uncommon.start.00,The old battlegrounds here are full of valuable items. Let's drive the monsters away and see what we find!
story.questline.beachparty.end.00,"That was a lot of fun! Hey, Mortimer, your team put up a good fight."

story.questline.beachparty.end.02,"Honk, honk!"
story.questline.beachparty.end.03,"I didn't want to scare you earlier, but Flip is the reigning water balloon fight grandmaster."
story.questline.beachparty.end.04,"Oh, now I understand why it was so difficult. Flip is the best!"
story.questline.beachparty.end.05,"Don't worry about it too much, it was a fun competition. Let's get on with the party!"
story.questline.beachparty.end.06,Sounds fantastic. There is unlimited ice cream for everyone!
story.questline.beachparty.start.00,"This beach party looks great! Thanks for inviting us, Mortimer!"
story.questline.beachparty.start.01,"No problem, Misty. I'm glad you could join us."
story.questline.beachparty.start.02,What's the main event this time? Why are there water balloons everywhere?
story.questline.beachparty.start.03,We have prepared a water balloon fight. It's going to be massive. You're welcome to join!
story.questline.beachparty.start.04,"That sounds like a lot of fun. My friend, Flip, is really good at slinging water balloons!"

story.questline.christmas.start.01,And I'm testing a pinch of cinnamon to spice up the hot chocolate!
story.questline.christmas.start.02,All the feast decorations are done.
story.questline.christmas.start.03,Boss! We are ready to hit the slopes.
story.questline.christmas.start.04,Well done everyone! It's time to show our guests a jolly good time!

story.questline.class_decimate.end.01,"Only I have the authority to declare things here! I, Balthazar, declare you victorious!"
story.questline.class_decimate.start.00,"I, Ulmer, am the most accomplished Wizard here. I welcome you to the Trials of Decimation."

story.questline.class_survivor.start.01,"Come on Azlar, let's show them a real challenge."
story.questline.costume_quest1.end.00,Hmm... Those bandits sure had some silly Costumes...
story.questline.costume_quest1.end.01,But look at you! What a transformation!
story.questline.costume_quest1.end.02,I'll take that as a compliment!
story.questline.costume_quest1.start.00,Welcome to the Masquerade! This is a...
story.questline.costume_quest1.start.01,"...wait, where is your Costume, Elena?"
story.questline.costume_quest1.start.02,You don't have a Costume either!
story.questline.costume_quest1.start.03,Aha! Those masked bandits must have taken them!
story.questline.costume_quest1.start.04,"Let's get the Costumes back, Commander!"
story.questline.covenant_1.end.00,Unimaginable! You are still on your feet.
story.questline.covenant_1.end.01,"You have well-earned our respect, and your passage forward."
story.questline.covenant_1.end.02,May your journey be filled with great challenges.
story.questline.covenant_1.start.00,"Have you ever seen a land like this? Ice and fire, both withstanding each other!"
story.questline.covenant_1.start.01,"If the land itself shows such a great persistence, I wonder what lies ahead of us..."
story.questline.covenant_1.start.02,That would be the Covenant of Champions!
story.questline.covenant_1.start.03,"A place for the most exceptional warriors, as only rare few are honored with our membership."
story.questline.covenant_1.start.04,Which is why I cannot let any ordinary travelers wander around here.
story.questline.covenant_1.start.05,"Oh! But now that I look at you, something tells me you have seen a battle or two. Hmm..."
story.questline.covenant_1.start.06,Here is the deal! You must earn your passage through this land by fighting our Champions!
story.questline.covenant_1.start.07,"Now, which weapon would you prefer?"
story.questline.covenant_2.end.00,Unimaginable! You are still on your feet.

story.questline.dragon_battle_and_crafting.end.00,And so it happened like the stars foretold. Use these items well.
story.questline.dragon_battle_and_crafting.start.00,"The stars have foretold: You will find many items tonight, should you venture further into the night skies."
story.questline.dragon_dragonlings_and_xp.end.00,Thank you! We should train them to grow into great Dragons!
story.questline.dragon_dragonlings_and_xp.start.00,Dragonlings have escaped into the night! Please find and rescue them!
story.questline.dragon_dragonstone_and_fish.end.00,Are you going to eat those or use them to expand the Dragonspire?
story.questline.dragon_dragonstone_and_fish.start.00,This river is filled with Dragonstone and Fish. Help me catch the delicious fish!
story.questline.dragon_element_blue.end.00,You endured well. May the warm dragon fire light your way!
story.questline.dragon_element_blue.start.00,Welcome to the ice-cold Sapphire Cavern. Be careful not to freeze up!
story.questline.dragon_element_extra.end.00,The rumors were true! Use it wisely.
story.questline.dragon_element_extra.start.00,The Rainbow Cavern is rumored to hold a chalice containing the powers of all five elements. Let's be careful!
story.questline.dragon_element_extra2.end.00,You claimed the pendant! Use its power carefully.
story.questline.dragon_element_extra2.start.00,The sentinels of this cavern are said to guard the Dragonstone Pendant. Prepare yourself well!
story.questline.dragon_element_green.end.00,"The power of nature is impressive, right? Well fought."
story.questline.dragon_element_green.start.00,This is the fabled Jade Cavern. It holds the power of nature. Stay on your guard!
story.questline.dragon_element_purple.end.00,You did well! Holy Dragons are strong against the Dark Dragons.
story.questline.dragon_element_purple.start.00,This cavern radiates with dark energy. Be careful that it won't consume you!
story.questline.dragon_element_red.end.00,"Well done, you prevailed well against the test of fire."
story.questline.dragon_element_red.start.00,"The rubies here are sharp as thorns. Be careful, as the cuts burn like fire!"
story.questline.dragon_element_yellow.end.00,Well fought. These items are great for Dragon Ascension.
story.questline.dragon_element_yellow.start.00,Did you know topaz has some cleansing qualities? Prepare yourself!
story.questline.dragon_legendary.end.00,That was a tough battle. I was barely able to beat you.
story.questline.dragon_legendary.end.01,"You have trained well. Last time we met, you weren't this powerful."
story.questline.dragon_legendary.end.02,"Since you have bested us, here is a Legendary Dragon Token. You can use it to summon new allies."
story.questline.dragon_legendary.end.03,"Thank you, Lux! This will help me a lot!"
story.questline.dragon_legendary.end.04,"My pleasure. Now, travel safely, Blaze."
story.questline.dragon_legendary.start.00,Lux! We meet again.
story.questline.dragon_legendary.start.01,"Hello, Blaze. I hope you have been well since we last met."
story.questline.dragon_legendary.start.02,"It's been quite rough recently. I am looking for new allies, but nobody wants to join my party."
story.questline.dragon_legendary.start.03,"I see. Would you like to challenge me and my companions? If you win, I will give you a reward that will help you."
story.questline.dragon_legendary.start.04,That sounds good! Let's battle!
story.questline.dragon_scroll.end.00,Ancient Knowledge of Dragons is power. Use it well!
story.questline.dragon_scroll.start.00,"Ancient knowledge of Dragons is hidden deep within this cave. Stay alert, as there might be guardians protecting the cave!"
story.questline.easter.end.00,Great! I knew you could do it!
story.questline.easter.end.01,Very nice. I'm impressed!
story.questline.easter.end.02,And now we celebrate!
story.questline.easter.end.03,Springvale Festival is the best! It was awesome that you could join us!
story.questline.easter.start.00,The Springvale Festival is about to begin! Let's go!
story.questline.easter.start.01,"Jack, would you let this rookie join so easily?"
story.questline.easter.start.02,"Well... The more the merrier, right?"
story.questline.easter.start.03,We'll see if they can manage... This festival is not for rookies!
story.questline.easter.start.04,Bring it on!
story.questline.element_blue.end.00,"The ice warriors just refuse to stay down... if we slay one, it eventually gets back up again."
story.questline.element_blue.end.01,"We stopped them for now, though. I wonder if this is the last we've seen of them..."
story.questline.element_blue.start.00,The people in this region firmly believe that an unnatural winter is coming.
story.questline.element_blue.start.01,"Look out! Icy warriors are emerging from the blizzard, hungry for fight!"
story.questline.element_extra.end.00,"The attack was a success! We've scattered the vile forces far and wide, and it'll take a good while for the enemies to regroup."
story.questline.element_extra.start.00,This remote mountain pass serves as a main transport route for armies of evil. We can slow down their operations with a surprise strike here!
story.questline.element_extra2.end.00,"The attack was a success! We've scattered the vile forces far and wide, and it'll take a good while for the enemies to regroup."
story.questline.element_extra2.start.00,This remote mountain pass serves as a main transport route for armies of evil. We can slow down their operations with a surprise strike here!
story.questline.element_green.end.00,The guardian beasts had been corrupted by the Dark Lord... and we had no choice but to stop them.
story.questline.element_green.end.01,The residents of the forest appreciate our help. We may even later get the permission to explore the lost ruins of the forest!
story.questline.element_green.start.00,Shrikewood... the forest has been forbidden for outsiders for ages. It's said to be guarded by mighty beasts.
story.questline.element_green.start.01,"We've received a plea for help from within... it may be a trap, but it's our duty to do what we can!"
story.questline.element_purple.end.00,"The vampire lord has been driven away. It was kind of easier than I expected, though."
story.questline.element_purple.end.01,"I wonder if there's a Vampire King somewhere, ruling above all the lords? Or maybe a Vampire Queen? Maybe we'll find out someday!"
story.questline.element_purple.start.00,"Morlovia! A country full of cemeteries, mist and ruined castles. How charming!"
story.questline.element_purple.start.01,Why am I not surprised to learn that a vampire lord has been sighted here? Let's stop him before he causes more harm!
story.questline.element_red.end.00,The dragon was about to ignite the entire volcano! We stopped it at the last minute!
story.questline.element_red.end.01,The volcano is quiet for now... but I don't think this is the last we've seen of dragons here.
story.questline.element_red.start.00,"This volcano has been dormant for hundreds of years... but something has activated it, threatening nearby lands!"
story.questline.element_red.start.01,I bet my boots that a dragon of some kind is behind this. Let's investigate!
story.questline.element_yellow.end.00,"Yes, we've found a well-hidden oasis amidst the sandy dunes!"
story.questline.element_yellow.end.01,We can rest at the oasis if we ever decide to explore further into this vast desert.
story.questline.element_yellow.start.00,"It's very dry here, not a drop of water anywhere to be found. But the area is also swarming with monsters..."
story.questline.element_yellow.start.01,There must be a hidden oasis somewhere. Let's look for it!
story.questline.food.end.00,"Great job, this will keep our people fed for a while."
story.questline.food.start.00,Let's hunt for food for our army!
story.questline.gem.end.00,The city must have been rich indeed! I wonder if we can find more some other day?
story.questline.gem.start.00,I've read that a mighty city once stood here. Let's look for treasure!
story.questline.gem_uncommon.end.00,These treasures were guarded lightly. Maybe there are still more secrets that this city hides from us.
story.questline.gem_uncommon.start.00,We've found new areas of the ancient city to explore!
story.questline.goblin.end.00,Our mightiest warriors have been defeated. We shall trade with you.
story.questline.goblin.end.01,"That was a good fight indeed. But I must insist on carrying out our duty, and confiscating any dangerous items."
story.questline.goblin.end.02,We can't give up our goods without any payment. Our mighty boars would go hungry.
story.questline.goblin.end.03,I've never seen boars that big! They must need a lot of food.
story.questline.goblin.end.04,Perhaps we can come to an agreement.
story.questline.goblin.end.05,Let us enter the warriors' hall then and dine while we talk. There is goblin carrot stew for all.
story.questline.goblin.end.06,Thank you for your hospitality. Let's enjoy the stew!
story.questline.goblin.start.00,Halt! Who goes there?
story.questline.goblin.start.01,"We are heroes, enjoying our vacation. We were coming to the Goblin village to trade for supplies."
story.questline.goblin.start.02,Are you trading here too? We haven't seen you before.
story.questline.goblin.start.03,"We are the Garrison Guard, sworn to maintain order in the land once your Free Army had driven out the Dark Lord."
story.questline.goblin.start.04,We have orders to confiscate illegal fireworks and dangerous items being sold by Goblins. There have been injuries in the area.
story.questline.goblin.start.05,"No cutting in line! If you want our supplies, you will have to brawl for them like everyone else."
story.questline.goblin.start.06,"Brawl? If we must, we must."
story.questline.guestip1.end.00,"I never back down,"
story.questline.guestip1.end.01,I never quit!
story.questline.guestip1.end.02,Acknowledge Me
story.questline.guestip1.end.03,Fiat Lux
story.questline.guestip1.start.00,A Portal to a new dimension is opening.
story.questline.guestip1.start.01,"In the distance, an audience is cheering."
story.questline.guestip1.start.02,The tournament begins! Are you ready?
story.questline.guestip1.start.03,"Live fast, fight hard, no regrets!"
story.questline.halloween.end.00,No! This is impossible! You mortals have defeated us in our own court!
story.questline.halloween.end.01,"Father, these heroes proved to be a match for our family..."
story.questline.halloween.end.02,So it seems my child. We shall get our feast the next time we meet!
story.questline.halloween.start.00,You have arrived to the Court of the Vampire King.
story.questline.halloween.start.01,"Father, I'm hungry. Who are these intruders?"
story.questline.halloween.start.02,It's your lucky night my child. We'll be feasting soon!
story.questline.hotm_quest1.end.00,The battle... it's already over...
story.questline.hotm_quest1.end.01,"Well, that was quite a brawl. And all of us had use for our skills!"
story.questline.hotm_quest1.end.02,"It seems combining our powers made us stronger, after all."
story.questline.hotm_quest1.end.03,Stronger. Together.
story.questline.hotm_quest1.end.04,"Good work, everyone!"
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.00,Hey! You!
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.01,"Yes, I mean You, Commander!"
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.02,We're discussing what is the absolute best way to prevail in combat.
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.03,Fire. Fire burns everything.
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.04,I'd rather snipe the enemy with a cursed arrow.
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.05,"Hah. Destruction is easy. But unlike you two, I bring things to life!"
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.06,Oh but I can -
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.07,"Whoa, watch out! The whole tavern is getting all worked up about this!"
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.08,A battle is brewing...
story.questline.hotm_quest1.start.09,The brawl has already started! Fight!
story.questline.iron.end.00,"That's a good amount of iron there, let's head back to base."

story.questline.lunarnewyear.end.01,Indeed! Our changing of the guard was dignified and joyous. This heralds a year of growth and good fortune.
story.questline.lunarnewyear.end.02,I have also prepared sweet rice balls for dessert. Let them bring you abundance and joy in the coming year.
story.questline.lunarnewyear.end.03,We do hope you'll come and celebrate again next year. The lanterns will guide you back to us.

story.questline.lunarnewyear.start.06,It is important to find a balance between our duties and joyous festivities with friends and family.

story.questline.magic_impossible.end.00,"Ah! Welcome! My name is Agrafena, I'm the Superintendent Supreme."
story.questline.magic_impossible.end.01,I've been following your ascent and you have shown great promise with your skills. I am most impressed.
story.questline.magic_impossible.end.02,Lovely talent indeed. I did not believe you would actually make it to the top. You have earned our respect. See you again soon!
story.questline.magic_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.00,Great work! You really taught our students a lesson!
story.questline.magic_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.01,We're not the only ones with fancy tricks.
story.questline.magic_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.02,That wasn't so bad!
story.questline.magic_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.03,Come back at any time.
story.questline.magic_normal.start.00,What brings you to the Tower of Magic?
story.questline.magic_normal.start.01,The doors of these halls are open only for the most promising students of magic.
story.questline.magic_normal.start.02,Do you think you've got what it takes?
story.questline.magic_normal.start.03,"Well I could give it a shot, I have always wanted to try my hand at a few spells."

story.questline.monster_island.end.3,"Agreed. Working alongside everyone was great fun, too — it's been a while since all of us gathered in one place like this."
story.questline.monster_island.end.4,"Those Apex Monsters were much tougher than expected. If we do return, we should aim to come back better equipped."
story.questline.monster_island.end.5,I reckon our teamwork could use a bit of improvement as well. We probably could've navigated the island more efficiently!
story.questline.monster_island.end.6,True. Let's take some time to streamline our plans before the next hunt.
story.questline.monster_island.start.0,A remote island shrouded in mist and mystery...
story.questline.monster_island.start.1,So this is the hidden island! After countless failed search expeditions... we're finally here.
story.questline.monster_island.start.2,I reckon this place has been hidden for a good reason. I hear odd noises from the wilderness and the air reeks of danger.
story.questline.monster_island.start.3,"Nonsense, it's YOU who reeks after several weeks on a boat!"
story.questline.monster_island.start.4,This place is bound to be exactly the right spot for hunting both monsters and treasure!
story.questline.ninja.level_04.onlevelcompleted.00,"So, you have made it past the first floors."
story.questline.ninja.level_04.onlevelcompleted.01,You are either brave or a fool...
story.questline.ninja.level_04.onlevelcompleted.02,"Either way, your resolve will be tested."
story.questline.ninja.level_09.onlevelcompleted.00,I... I can feel something trying to weaken us...
story.questline.ninja.level_09.onlevelcompleted.01,It must be the curses. We should keep going.
story.questline.ninja.level_09.onlevelcompleted.02,Upward!
story.questline.ninja.level_14.onlevelcompleted.00,"You have potential, I give you that."
story.questline.ninja.level_14.onlevelcompleted.01,"The real test begins now, let's see what you're truly made of!"
story.questline.ninja.level_19.onlevelcompleted.00,Zai! Kai! Rin! Pyo!
story.questline.ninja.level_19.onlevelcompleted.01,You are still climbing the tower?
story.questline.ninja.level_19.onlevelcompleted.02,As if we'd ever give up!
story.questline.ninja.level_19.onlevelcompleted.03,"Steel your determination, the true test awaits!"
story.questline.ninja.level_24.onlevelcompleted.00,We made it!
story.questline.ninja.level_24.onlevelcompleted.01,You have walked the way of the ninja...
story.questline.ninja.level_24.onlevelcompleted.02,"And now you are here, despite the odds."
story.questline.ninja.level_24.onlevelcompleted.03,You have our utmost respect.
story.questline.ninja.start.00,"The Ninja Tower is back, I really want to climb it!"
story.questline.ninja.start.01,Our clan grows stronger and only the best can reach the top!
story.questline.ninja.start.02,With each floor more treacherous than the last...
story.questline.ninja.start.03,The strong will be blessed and the weak cursed into oblivion.
story.questline.ninja.start.04,Now step forward!
story.questline.ninja_impossible.end.00,"Wait, when did you manage to get all the way up here?"
story.questline.ninja_impossible.end.01,You're not supposed to know we get our powers from pizza.
story.questline.ninja_impossible.end.02,I award you the title of Master Ninja. Now scram before our food gets cold!
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.00,That climb was much longer than I expected.
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.01,Who are you?
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.02,I am Elena and I'm searching for the wisdom of the owls.
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.03,"Ah, you have come to the right place. Ask away, I'm owl ears."
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.04,What?
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.05,I am the wisest of the owls. You could say I know it owl.
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.06,Wait a minute...
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.07,You're just saying all the owl puns you know!
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.08,This is what beak performance looks like.
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.09,I've had enough.
story.questline.owl_impossible.end.10,Owl by myself again.
story.questline.owl_normal.level_09.onlevelcompleted.00,You have proven capable as a warrior.
story.questline.owl_normal.level_09.onlevelcompleted.01,We owls seek to protect the forests and its hidden wisdom.
story.questline.owl_normal.level_09.onlevelcompleted.02,Now let us test your acumen. Does it match your strong sword arm?
story.questline.owl_normal.level_09.onlevelcompleted.03,The next challenges will be most fierce!
story.questline.owl_normal.level_19.onlevelcompleted.00,"Your wit is keen, but we are not yet convinced."
story.questline.owl_normal.level_19.onlevelcompleted.01,Now graced by moonlight you shall face our true might.
story.questline.owl_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.00,I welcome you adventurers!
story.questline.owl_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.01,You have reached the top of our hallowed tower.
story.questline.owl_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.02,And on each floor you faced a challenge set by our Parliament.
story.questline.owl_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.03,"You have proven worthy of an audience, but remember that every end can also be a new beginning."
story.questline.owl_normal.start.00,Is this the Realm of the Owls?
story.questline.owl_normal.start.01,The owls are wise and have much knowledge of all things mystical.
story.questline.owl_normal.start.02,Welcome to the Parliament of the Owls.
story.questline.owl_normal.start.03,Scale our tower to meet with our elders.
story.questline.owl_normal.start.04,"But remember, we will judge you on the way."
story.questline.owl_normal.start.05,Only the most worthy shall reach the top.
story.questline.recruits.end.00,Good work. These recruits will surely help us in the times ahead.
story.questline.recruits.start.00,We can find more recruits from these lands if we drive away the monsters.
story.questline.recruits_uncommon.end.00,Excellent. These men and women are a great addition to our army.
story.questline.recruits_uncommon.start.00,The people here are ready to join our cause if we help them out first.
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.end.00,That was a mighty battle!
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.end.01,It was an honor to fight at your side. That was so awesome!
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.end.02,"It is not over yet. Grendel is not slain, so I will track him to his lair."
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.end.03,"There will be time for that later. First, we will feast!"
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.end.04,"Welcome to Heorot, the mead-hall of the Danes! Let there be food and drink and tales of glorious battles!"
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.start.00,"Instead of the mighty mead-hall Heorot, you find a small camp on the moors. It shows signs of having been constructed hastily."
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.start.01,"Welcome, noble warriors! This meal is but a meagre shadow of what it should be, but we will share what we have."
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.start.02,"My queen speaks true. Heorot has been taken over by the monster Grendel, and we cannot toast you properly."
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.start.03,"That is why we are here! I am Beowulf, the greatest warrior of the Geats. I will do battle with Grendel and drive him off."
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.start.04,"Big words, but I'm not seeing much to back them up."
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.start.05,"Watch me. Just for you, I'll even fight him hand to hand! I don't need a sword."
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.start.06,You will have our support.
story.questline.recurringbeowulf.start.07,And ours.
story.questline.recurringcircus.end.00,Splendid! You are rather talented!
story.questline.recurringcircus.end.01,I'm laughing my head off! That was so much fun.
story.questline.recurringcircus.end.02,A purr-fect show.
story.questline.recurringcircus.end.03,Let us perform together the next time we are in town!
story.questline.recurringcircus.start.00,"Welcome to Starfall Circus, I am Director Zuri. Meet some of our esteemed performers."
story.questline.recurringcircus.start.01,Are you ready to be entertained?
story.questline.recurringcircus.start.02,We have all sorts of tricks prepared for you...
story.questline.recurringcircus.start.03,Let us see how well you can handle them.
story.questline.recurringfestival.end.00,Hansel! You're here as well! I'm so glad I found you.
story.questline.recurringfestival.end.01,Sister! I've been looking for you!
story.questline.recurringfestival.end.02,"At least they found each other. I have to say, this has been weird. I never knew there were other worlds..."
story.questline.recurringfestival.end.03,"Aye, young lass. Let us share this fine treasure and go look for more!"
story.questline.recurringfestival.end.04,"You all are rather peculiar, but I'm still fond of you."
story.questline.recurringfestival.end.05,So it seems our realms got mixed up. It was a delight to meet you all and see your worlds.
story.questline.recurringfestival.start.00,"Yarr, there be loot to be plundered in this new world. Wait, where are we, to be precise?"
story.questline.recurringfestival.start.01,Who are you supposed to be and are we not in Wonderland?
story.questline.recurringfestival.start.02,"Wonderland? Quit your tomfoolery, miss. I have never heard of such place!"
story.questline.recurringfestival.start.03,I must have taken a wrong turn at some point... Has anyone seen my sister?
story.questline.recurringfestival.start.04,"Listen everyone, I think our realms have gotten mixed up somehow..."
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.00,And so the madrigal of mayhem ends...
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.01,No matter! We will return! Next time we'll be unstoppable!
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.02,"WE WON, YOU FOOL!"
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.03,"Great work, everyone! You all are worthy of being called Slayers."
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.04,"No idea what that means, but it sounds better than ""League of Villains""."
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.05,SILENCE!
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.06,"I was hasty to judge you, clown. You fight well."
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.07,You're not too bad yourself. You would kill it on the flying trapeze!
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.08,The flying what?
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.end.09,I agree! Welcome to our troupe!
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.00,I have gathered the vilest villains from all corners of...
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.01,Wait. This isn't Karemdol. Where are we?
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.02,I should have known that joining you would be a waste of time!
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.03,SILENCE!
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.04,"Hey, cool outfits you got there. Are you here for the audition?"
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.05,"The green one could be a fortune-teller. Wait, where's our tent?"
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.06,Who are you and what on earth happened to your head?
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.07,And yet he's still on his feet. I've never met such a worthy challenger!
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.08,Hmph. I'd rather not stoop down to the level of a clown.
story.questline.recurringfestivalb.start.09,And so the madrigal of mayhem begins...
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.00,Impossible. Our stoneskin cannot be pierced...
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.01,Yet your weapons have managed to do so. How thrilling!
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.02,"Well, I have had a lot of practice smashing things with this hammer."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.03,Or maybe all that standing still outside in the rain has made you two weaker?
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.04,"A possibility, to be sure. Regardless, you truly are remarkable fighters."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.05,"Loath as I am to admit it, these mortals may be our equals in combat."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.06,"Sorry about the mess, though. We didn't mean to smash that spire."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.07,No matter. It would not be this structure's first restoration... or even the second.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.end.08,Feel free to return in the future. We look forward to being challenged again.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.00,I wonder what secrets may lie hidden inside this old cathedral!
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.01,It's uncanny how we keep running into new locations to explore.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.02,Who dares disturb our slumber? Your intrusion is most unwelcome.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.03,Indeed. Yet I am also intrigued. Few mortals have ever breached our sanctuary.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.04,Ech... I knew that the spooky sculpture in the garden was bad luck.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.05,Wait. I think she looks just like that sinister statue outside. See those horns?
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.06,I AM that statue! Have you never seen a Gargoyle? What grotesque ignorance.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.07,Agreed. Perhaps we should show them how impenetrable our stone skin is.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles.start.08,Richard...! Grab your hammer.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.00,This cathedral looks a lot like the one we visited before.
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.01,"True, this one just looks more...mossy."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.02,"Oh no, someone has entered our peaceful home."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.03,"Ah visitors, welcome."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.04,I knew it! Those creepy gargoyles again...
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.05,"Wait, these look different somehow."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.06,"Oh no, now the intruders also talk."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.07,"I'm sorry, my friend here is sort of an introvert. Unlike the rest of us."
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.08,Let me guess... this all ends up in a big challenge like last time?
story.questline.recurringgargoyles2.start.09,Challenge? Ah yes!
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.00,"That was an amazing carnival! A bit exhausting, but I had a really great time."
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.01,"I agree! Hopefully we'll be able to come back next, uh... whenever the next carnival is."
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.02,I'd love to come in another costume next time! But I wonder whether we'll be able to come here again.
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.03,"Fortunately, there is no need to worry. You all are fated to visit this place again."
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.04,That's great news! Could you also tell us when that will be?
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.05,You will be summoned here when the time is right. One might call it... a fated summon.
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.06,One may NOT! That means something else. Please stop misleading these mortals.
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.07,"I didn't really get that one, but anyway, thanks for showing us around."
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.end.08,"See you again, then — sometime soon!"
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.00,"Wow. I have no idea how we got here, but this place looks absolutely gorgeous!"
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.01,Yes. And it looks like the streets are gearing up for a festival of some sort...
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.02,"Greetings, travellers. You are a perceptive lot. This city's famed carnival starts tomorrow."
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.03,I can barely conceal my excitement.
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.04,I would say your mask is concealing your excitement quite well.
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.05,Looks like we've arrived just in time!
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.06,Yes. What good fortune.
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.07,"Wait, you two are both wearing masks. Do we need masks to take part? Oh no..."
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.08,Yes. What bad fortune.
story.questline.recurringmasquerade.start.09,"Heed her not — she speaks in jest. All attending gods will be masked, but mortals are free to join without one."
story.questline.recurringmightypets.end.00,"...and that's the story of Hachiko, the Puppy of Loyalty, as told by Max the Storyteller!"
story.questline.recurringmightypets.end.01,"Or that's how it was told to me when I was a wee duckling. It's quite an old tale, apparently."
story.questline.recurringmightypets.end.02,"Quite a tearjerker. Makes me think of my old caretakers. Thanks for sharing it, Waddles."
story.questline.recurringmightypets.end.03,"My pleasure, Ribbit. It's one of my favorites, even though I get a bit jealous of dogs when I tell it."
story.questline.recurringmightypets.end.04,"I understand. Ducks don't have it easy here. Somebody shoots rubber pellets at you every now and then, right?"
story.questline.recurringmightypets.end.05,"Once every fortnight or so, like clockwork. And they always aim for exactly 10 of us... none of us know why."
story.questline.recurringmightypets.end.06,"They better have a really good reason for doing so. If not, we should let them learn the power of mighty pets!"
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.00,"...no luck again, Hachiko?"
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.01,I'm afraid not. But the next expedition might yield some answers! I'll set out again tomorrow.
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.02,It's been many years now. There must be better things for you to do. Maybe it's time to call it quits?
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.03,No way. I'm sure he's still trying to make it back to our meeting point. It's just a matter of time.
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.04,"As dedicated as ever, I see. I say a statue should be raised in honor of your loyalty!"
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.05,"Nah, that sounds silly. What good would a statue of me do, anyway?"
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.06,"Well, I was speaking in jest... But come to think of it — if we place one at the meeting point..."
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.07,"Even if you're not there when he gets back, he'll know that you've been waiting. Wouldn't that be nice?"
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.08,"Wait, that sounds brilliant! Thanks Max, you're a genius!"
story.questline.recurringmightypets.start.09,I'm sure one will be raised when more people learn of you. The world could always use more mighty pets.
story.questline.recurringopera.end.00,"I can see the door again, but the Entertainers are blocking the way. It seems they will never let us leave and my sword weighs a ton already."
story.questline.recurringopera.end.01,"♫ You've seen our faces here ♫
                                        ♫ But do not fear ♫

story.questline.recurringopera.end.04,That was an ordeal! I think I've had my share of fine arts for a while.
story.questline.recurringopera.start.00,Wow! I didn't know we had such an awesome Opera House. I need to tell Vivica about this!
story.questline.recurringopera.start.01,"Nice place you got here Elena, but be careful. I've heard about this place. It is full of secrets and the word is that it's haunted... and I can hear eerie singing."

story.questline.recurringopera.start.09,"Looks like the doors behind us have disappeared. No choice, but to venture further into the Opera House..."
story.questline.recurringslayers.end.00,In the name of Crom! Our opponent still stands!
story.questline.recurringslayers.end.01,I was hasty to judge you. Perhaps one should never underestimate their opponents.
story.questline.recurringslayers.end.02,You are worthy of being called a Slayer.
story.questline.recurringslayers.end.03,Come find us if you ever wish to hunt some monsters... or test your strength!
story.questline.recurringslayers.end.04,We will train tirelessly until our next encounter.
story.questline.recurringslayers.end.05,You'd better do the same!
story.questline.recurringslayers.start.00,"Far and wide, we have searched for a worthy challenger..."
story.questline.recurringslayers.start.01,"Saoirse turns towards you, eyeing you dismissively."
story.questline.recurringslayers.start.02,Looks like we have to keep looking. This one clearly doesn't have what it takes to survive a battle with us.
story.questline.recurringslayers.start.03,I will take on any opponent that has the bravery to face me.
story.questline.recurringslayers.start.04,"Go on, then, weakling..."
story.questline.recurringslayers.start.05,Let's see what you've got!
story.questline.recurringvillains.end.00,We lost!
story.questline.recurringvillains.end.01,I should have known that joining this League would be a waste of time!
story.questline.recurringvillains.end.02,"Such incompetence. If only I had been the leader, we would have crushed the heroes with ease."
story.questline.recurringvillains.end.03,"...hmm, it seems the League of Villains is not operating to its full potential quite yet..."
story.questline.recurringvillains.end.04,No matter! We will return! Next time we'll be unstoppable!
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.00,Well well...it's good to be back in business. The business of evil!
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.01,I have gathered the vilest villains from all corners of Karemdol...
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.02,...and the League of Villains will be unstoppable under my control!
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.03,Wait... WHAT?!
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.04,"Why should WE bow to YOU? I should be the one in charge, with the might of nature at my command!"
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.05,No...
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.06,You? A leader?
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.07,You puny little garden plant! I could freeze your roots within an instant...
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.08,SILENCE!
story.questline.recurringvillains.start.09,"I will show you all my true power. Let's find some ""heroes"" to slay!"
story.questline.scavenging.end.00,I think that's all for now. Let's return some other day for another look.
story.questline.scavenging.start.00,Let's check out the shore. Who knows what the tide has brought in.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.end.00,Not bad.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.end.01,That was insanity.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.end.02,That jewel! It belongs to us. Hand it over!
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.end.03,"It's from the Devil Reef, isn't it? Take us there, and I'll think about it."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.end.04,As you wish.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.end.05,"Atwood, I like taking risks, but your curiosity might put us in grave danger. These cultists are way too forthcoming."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.end.06,"Dolores, we are Investigators. We don't shy away from danger when uncovering a mystery."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.00,The Jewel of the Deep is glowing. The rumors about the Deep ones in the area are true.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.01,Something is not right. Where are all the villagers?
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.02,Your pendant. It's glowing as well!
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.03,That's a bad omen. Something very evil is lurking here.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.04,"You called, dear?"
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.05,Atwood and Dolores suddenly feel an overwhelming rush of insanity consuming their minds.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.06,Hysteria. Don't break the investigators' minds just yet. They might not be ready.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.07,A little insanity never hurt anybody...
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.08,"Oh, we are pretty familiar with it."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.09,Shall we put that to the test?
story.questline.shadow_quest_part1.start.10,Devout of the Deep! Show these Investigators the true meaning of insanity in the name of the Old Ones!
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.00,How did it feel to embrace insanity?
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.01,It felt like home. Can we leave now?
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.02,Only after giving us the jewel!
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.03,About that. I just wanted to collect data about its origin.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.04,"Professor, it's time."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.05,Thank you for the hospitality!
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.06,"Dolores opens her locket, and suddenly, a portal appears. Atwood and Dolores jump inside it and disappear."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.07,"Unexpected, but we got what we wanted."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.08,Well done bringing them here. Our master can touch the dark corners of their minds now.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.09,Haha! They clearly have no idea what that jewel is!
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.end.10,Let's keep it that way.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.00,My pendant is going haywire.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.01,They don't know what it is. Let's keep it that way.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.02,It's rude to whisper in front of others.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.03,We are here.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.04,Who would have thought a lighthouse would be the door to a realm infested with eldritch horrors.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.05,"A warning. Unless you embrace the insanity, you won't survive."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.06,How kind of you to warn us.
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.07,"Suddenly, a dark form twisting and turning emerges from the sea and takes shape."
story.questline.shadow_quest_part2.start.08,Follow me. May insanity guide us.
story.questline.starter_easy.end.00,Whew! What a fight!
story.questline.starter_easy.end.01,We are lucky that the dragon flew away. It acted like it was possessed!
story.questline.starter_easy.end.02,But who could do something like this?
story.questline.starter_easy.end.03,Look! It left behind traces of dark magical dust.
story.questline.starter_easy.end.04,With it's compounds I can create a counter spell for us.
story.questline.starter_easy.end.05,Good call! Maybe we can help these dragons.
story.questline.starter_easy.end.06,Heroes to the rescue!
story.questline.starter_easy.start.00,Heroes are tracking traces of recent mysterious attacks on the mountains.
story.questline.starter_easy.start.01,There you are! We have been waiting for you. Let our quest begin!
story.questline.starter_easy.start.02,Did you see those claw marks on the way? Looks like we might be tracking a dragon!
story.questline.starter_easy.start.03,What an exiting case indeed. Let's see where these traces lead us!
story.questline.starter_hard.end.00,Dragons are finally free from the dark curse and back to their normal selves.
story.questline.starter_hard.end.01,Curse you heroes for releasing the mighty dragons from my command!
story.questline.starter_hard.end.02,Dark Lord disappears into the darkness.
story.questline.starter_hard.end.03,Thank you for saving us from the dire curse.
story.questline.starter_hard.end.04,"If you ever need extra fire power, come find us."
story.questline.starter_hard.end.05,Save travels and farewell!
story.questline.starter_hard.end.06,I can't wait to brag about this at the tavern!
story.questline.starter_hard.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.00,"The curse is getting too strong, this whole land is in chaos."
story.questline.starter_hard.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.01,Look! There are the remaining dragons!
story.questline.starter_hard.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.02,I still need some time to compose a strong enough spell for all of them.
story.questline.starter_hard.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.03,We will cover for you!
story.questline.starter_medium.end.00,Urhg. My head feels foggy.
story.questline.starter_medium.end.01,"You're back to your senses, this means our spell must have worked!"
story.questline.starter_medium.end.02,"You may have saved this one, but my army is of many."
story.questline.starter_medium.end.03,Soon I will have this whole world in my hands.
story.questline.starter_medium.end.04,We need to find rest of the cursed dragons before the curse consumes their spirits!
story.questline.starter_medium.end.05,To the dragon's keep!
story.questline.starter_medium.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.00,We are on the edge of the dragon territory. Stay alert!
story.questline.starter_medium.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.01,But the traces end here. Which way now?
story.questline.starter_medium.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.02,Suddenly ominous sounds echo from distance and tremble the ground.
story.questline.starter_medium.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.03,It came from this way!
story.questline.starter_medium.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.04,Onward!
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.00,You actually made it! I can't believe it. Thank you so much!
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.01,No problem. We're glad to see you alive! How long have you been here?
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.02,I don't know what date it is now... but I entered the tower on the 25th of March.
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.03,"Wow, so you've been stuck in here for ages! No, wait... Hmm. Okay, so —"
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.04,"That's not important, Richard. Come on, Dante, let's get back home!"
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.05,"Of course. Hey, wait! Isn't this way going further down?"
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.06,"You must be really tired. Don't worry, this is the right direction. We're heading up."
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.07,Now you will row... against the current... Far more danger... lies ahead...
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_24.onlevelcompleted.00,Incredible. Very few mortals manage to clamber back up from the eternal night.
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_24.onlevelcompleted.01,I will see to it that your efforts are rewarded. My children will have learned much from you.
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_24.onlevelcompleted.02,"My apologies, dear mother... But rest assured... More will come... and most will stay..."
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_24.onlevelcompleted.03,"That really doesn't bode well, does it?"
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_24.onlevelcompleted.04,"Yet for some reason, I feel like we might end up coming here again."
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_24.onlevelcompleted.05,"Anyhow, thanks for showing us around, Charon! See you."
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_24.onlevelcompleted.06,The group exit the tower — and find the overworld draped with the scintillant night sky.
story.questline.styx_impossible.level_24.onlevelcompleted.07,"And so we emerge, to see — once more — the stars..."
story.questline.styx_normal.end.01,Right. Now to find the person we came to rescue.
story.questline.styx_normal.end.02,I'm beginning to worry Dante might not have survived. Nothing's edible here!
story.questline.styx_normal.end.03,Tell me about it. I'm starving!
story.questline.styx_normal.end.04,Worry not... He has been kept fed... For a price...
story.questline.styx_normal.end.05,You make everything sound so ominous! But please lead us to him.
story.questline.styx_normal.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.00,"Welcome, surface-dwellers... to Styx... I shall be... your guide..."
story.questline.styx_normal.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.01,"Wait, I think I've seen you before. Weren't you some kind of merchant?"
story.questline.styx_normal.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.02,Surely not... Now let us proceed... Dangers lie ahead... I will ferry you safely...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_00.onlevelbuttonclick.03,For a price...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_01.onlevelbuttonclick.00,"Welcome, surface-dwellers... to Styx... I shall be... your guide..."
story.questline.styx_normal.level_01.onlevelbuttonclick.01,"Wait, I think I've seen you before. Weren't you some kind of merchant?"
story.questline.styx_normal.level_01.onlevelbuttonclick.02,Surely not... Now let us proceed... Dangers lie ahead... I will ferry you safely...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_01.onlevelbuttonclick.03,For a price...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_02.onlevelbuttonclick.00,From here on... the currents change... A different danger...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_02.onlevelbuttonclick.01,I will again take... some of your SOULs... for safekeeping...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_02.onlevelbuttonclick.02,If I do not... they may end up paying... a far higher price...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_05.onlevelbuttonclick.00,From here on... the currents change... A different danger...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_05.onlevelbuttonclick.01,I will again take... some of your SOULs... for safekeeping...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_05.onlevelbuttonclick.02,If I do not... they may end up paying... a far higher price...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.00,This is your destination... The center of the underworld...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.01,Right. Now to find the person we came to rescue.
story.questline.styx_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.02,I'm beginning to worry Dante might not have survived. Nothing's edible here!
story.questline.styx_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.03,Tell me about it. I'm starving!
story.questline.styx_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.04,Worry not... He has been kept fed... For a price...
story.questline.styx_normal.level_24.onlevelcompleted.05,You make everything sound so ominous! But please lead us to him.
story.questline.styx_normal.start.00,So this is the Tower of Styx.
story.questline.styx_normal.start.01,But it's only one story tall! Why is it called a tower?
story.questline.styx_normal.start.02,"Maybe this ""Dante"" person could explain, once we find and rescue him."
story.questline.styx_normal.start.03,I've never read such a long letter for help. But it was very beautifully written.
story.questline.styx_normal.start.04,"Eh, I hate reading long things. I could finish only about the first third of it."
story.questline.styx_normal.start.05,"An inscription on the gate reads: ""ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE"""
story.questline.styx_normal.start.06,"That doesn't bode well, does it? I hope Dante didn't write that..."
story.questline.styx_normal.start.07,"Surely not. Come on, let's go."
story.questline.styx_normal.start.08,The three heroes pass through the gate — and unwittingly enter the underworld.
story.questline.styx_normal.start.09,"Wow, it's just circles all the way down. So this is why it's called a tower!"
story.questline.summer.end.00,Scree!
story.questline.summer.end.01,"Yes, Roc, I also hope the explorers enjoyed their stay."
story.questline.summer.end.02,"As night turns to day, so shall my empire hide away."
story.questline.summer.end.03,We shall meet again when the time is right!
story.questline.summer.start.00,The Empire of Sand is well-hidden.
story.questline.summer.start.01,Not many have witnessed our castle emerging from the sand.
story.questline.summer.start.02,"Now that you have found us here, you may explore the secrets of the Empire of Sand."
story.questline.summer.start.03,Scree!
story.questline.summer.start.04,"That is true, my dearest Roc. The explorers need to watch their step."
story.questline.super_class_barbarian.end.00,"Commander, that was epic!"
story.questline.super_class_barbarian.end.01,You crushed us like a true barbarian!
story.questline.super_class_barbarian.start.00,"Some trials require patience, cunning and tactics."
story.questline.super_class_barbarian.start.01,Here we throw all that away.  You better brace yourself and RAGE!
story.questline.super_class_cleric.end.00,Yes that truly was a test! I shouldn't have expected less!
story.questline.super_class_cleric.start.00,Time to see if you are a master cleric. It would be a source of glee to see you flee.
story.questline.super_class_druid.end.00,Well done! You truly are one with the nature.
story.questline.super_class_druid.start.00,One must be in tune with nature to best these trials. Show proper respect and you might make it.
story.questline.super_class_fighter.end.00,Best. Fight. Ever!
story.questline.super_class_fighter.end.01,Congratulations Commander! You honor us with your prowess.
story.questline.super_class_fighter.start.00,Commander! Welcome! You will find no quarter given here.
story.questline.super_class_fighter.start.01,Yes! Only a true fighter can prosper in these trials! Time to draw your sword!
story.questline.super_class_monk.end.00,You are in harmony with yourself. Very Good.
story.questline.super_class_monk.start.00,A masterful monk is in perfect harmony with their inner powers. It's time to test your training.
story.questline.super_class_paladin.end.00,"Commander, evil had no hold on you. You truly are a devoted Paladin!"
story.questline.super_class_paladin.start.00,Duty! Justice! And Honor! Time to test your Paladin Oath!
story.questline.super_class_ranger.end.00,That was incredible Commander! It seems that you could have done that with our eyes closed.
story.questline.super_class_ranger.end.01,Pff. Lucky shot. I could have done it with all my four arms crossed.
story.questline.super_class_ranger.start.00,Here lies a challenge for a true marksman! May your aim be true commander.
story.questline.super_class_ranger.start.01,I doubt you can even use a bow.
story.questline.super_class_rogue.end.00,How did this happen? I didn't even see you move.
story.questline.super_class_rogue.end.01,You fooled us all. We underestimated your artful trickery.
story.questline.super_class_rogue.start.00,This trial will test your limits. A truly masterful Rogue uses cunning and speed to overcome any challenge.
story.questline.super_class_rogue.start.01,We are too fast for you. You wont see us until it is too late.
story.questline.super_class_sorcerer.end.00,You are a truly masterful sorcerer if I ever saw one!
story.questline.super_class_sorcerer.end.01,Such power! Such sheer will and determination!
story.questline.super_class_sorcerer.start.00,"Wizard think all magic is learned, but all sorcerers know true magic is something you are born with."
story.questline.super_class_sorcerer.start.01,This is a trial for a true sorcerer and not just some... Wizard!
story.questline.super_class_wizard.end.00,That was an exquisite display of magic Commander! I almost got burned by all that magic.
story.questline.super_class_wizard.end.01,The arcane arts suit you. We might even call you an equal.
story.questline.super_class_wizard.start.00,Mastering the art of magic requires deep study of the arcane. This separates us from the sorcerers who wield magic without finesse.
story.questline.super_class_wizard.start.01,I doubt your dedication is enough for this trial.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.end.00,"Excellent performance, noble heroes!"
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.end.01,You were....less weak than I expected.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.end.02,"Now now Zengar, I think that's not quite accurate. Their performance merits more recognition, wouldn't you agree?"
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.end.03,Hmph. Yes. It probably does.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.end.04,...congratulations. You were strong enough to face the perils of elemental space.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.end.05,Indeed. And we do hope to see you again!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.start.00,"So, you're the weaklings trying their luck in Contest of Elements?"
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.start.01,"Zengar, don't be rude. These contestants may well be worth our time."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.start.02,Bah. They look puny and weak. They're unfit for the challenges of elemental space.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_blue.start.03,Looks can be deceiving. Let us start the Contest and see just how strong these heroes are!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_green.end.00,"Whoa, the heroes did good! They beat us fair and square!"
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_green.end.01,"Much respect, I'd say! They totally anticipated our every move."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_green.end.02,It was fun though. We have to see how they do against the next element soon.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_green.end.03,I wouldn't miss it for the world! See you later heroes!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_green.start.00,"Well hello there! Welcome to Contest of Elements, heroes!"
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_green.start.01,The Elemental Space is a radical place...are you sure you're ready for it?
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_green.start.02,"Ready or not, sister, these heroes can't back out anymore."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_green.start.03,Right you are! Let's see how they fare against us!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.end.00,Splendid! Splendid I say!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.end.01,"We were bested, fair and square."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.end.02,"It was a hundred...no, two hundred years ago when this happened last time!"
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.end.03,And it's most invigorating! Clash of swords and sizzle of spells are music to my ears!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.end.04,"Heh, Griffex in a lively mood is truly a rare occurrence."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.end.05,"Thank you for this, adventurers, and fare well in your travels."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.start.00,Grumble...grumble...what am I going to do with these manuscripts? It's all nonsense. Nonsense I say!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.start.01,"Hey, Griffex. Snap out of it. We've got visitors."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.start.02,What? Who? Some so-called adventurers?
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.start.03,"Yes, and they claim to have already sailed across the vastness of Elemental Space."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.start.04,"Is that right? Hmph. Well, let's see how they fare against us."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_purple.start.05,"That's the spirit! We need to focus, these heroes are no pushovers."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.end.00,"Very impressive. You heroes weren't fragile or careless, after all."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.end.01,"Quite so, Doxan. The elemental space is merciless to those without merit..."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.end.02,But you heroes did not even flinch when facing the challenge!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.end.03,"We'll be seeing you again, heroes!"
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.start.00,"So, heroes, you've decided to board the galactic galleon?"
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.start.01,Are you certain you can handle this? You look somewhat...fragile.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.start.02,"I agree, Ignazio. They look like they could fall off the ship at any moment."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.start.03,The currents of elemental space have claimed many careless lives.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.start.04,Though I've heard rumors that they have already visited our friends around the elemental space.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_red.start.05,"Is that the case? Well then, this should prove to be interesting."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_yellow.end.00,Very impressive. You sailed the elemental currents...and survived.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_yellow.end.01,But know that there is much more to see in the vastness of space.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_yellow.end.02,"Next time, who knows what dangers you shall face."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_yellow.end.03,We hope to see you again in the Contest of Elements!
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_yellow.start.00,"Welcome to Contest of Elements, heroes."
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_yellow.start.01,You're very far from your home. The elemental space is a dangerous place for those unaccustomed to it.
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_yellow.start.02,We hope you're strong enough to travel aboard the galaxy galleon...
story.questline.super_elemental_quest_yellow.start.03,...and that you can withstand the challenges before you!
story.questline.tasklist_1_end_dialog_1,Our scouts spotted a Red Dragon guarding the mountain pass.

story.questline.tasklist_3_end_dialog_1,The Towers of Windemer... We must seize them to keep Dark Lord at bay.
story.questline.tasklist_3_end_dialog_2,"Keep training, building and leveling up. Those Towers will be ours!"
story.questline.tasklist_4_end_dialog_1,Way to go! You completed every single plan we had!

story.questline.valentinesseasonal.end.03,"We need to get going, unfortunately."
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.end.04,Aww... But you are always welcome back for another Cupid fight!
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.end.05,Thanks! We'll be back next year!
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.00,I swear this place looks familiar to me. I have been here before.
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.01,"I have never visited this place before, I'm sure of it."
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.02,Somewhere close by...
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.03,Himeros! It's that knight again!
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.04,"Oh, he sure gets lost often."
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.05,I have an idea!
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.06,Eros smirks. He draws an Arrow of Desire and points it towards Richard.
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.07,OW!
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.08,I suddenly feel the desire to...
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.09,SWING MY HAMMER!
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.10,Am I hearing a request for a Cupid fight?!
story.questline.valentinesseasonal.start.11,Cupid fight!!

story.season.dragon_s1_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Noctur! It's time for our Monster Mash! Who defeats more monsters wins!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,You never learn. I haven't lost this competition to you in over 50 years now.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Today is the day that I win!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Sure buddy.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"So, how does it feel to lose yet again?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Well, I'll win the next 100 years, so it doesn't matter."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Haha, you are such an optimist. Don't ever change."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"If I were an optimist, I would have said I'd win for the next 1000 years!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Woah! There is a dragon flying in the eye of the storm!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Stormcaller notices Richard and flies directly to him.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,You seem intrigued about the storm. Do you want to fly with me?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Sure, I fear nothing! Nothing dangerous about flying in a thunderstorm, right?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Richard hops on Stormcaller's back, and they fly high into the swirling dark clouds."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Wow, I felt the thunder rattling my armor!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Storms make flying way more interesting!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,My name is Stormcaller. Do you wanna fly again on the next storm?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Sure! I'm Richard, but flying in the storm made me feel like the god of thunder!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Looks like Stormcaller is forming a bond with Richard.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Blaze! I see some trouble ahead! Be careful!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Blaze is suddenly surrounded by many enraged monsters.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,This monster swarm is way bigger than usual!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"I don't know why, but I'm suddenly growing weaker."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,It's the weather. There is something off about it. Let's try working together!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I didn't know heroes could fight like that! Thank you for saving my tail!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I'm glad you're okay. Protecting someone else brings out the best in us.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,The skies of Dragonspire seem unstable. Is that why there are so many monsters and odd weather?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Yes. A long time ago, dragons and heroes made each other stronger by working together."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,But it's been more like an invisible bond for too long. Many dragons have lost faith in heroes.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I see... Faith is powerful as it keeps a light in our hearts.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,What a mysterious new place...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,It is intriguing how the bond between dragons and heroes can have such an impact on the weather.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Huh, it's suddenly growing dark quickly..."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Suddenly, Vivica sees an intense light emanating through the murky forest."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Hey, you, follow my light! This dusk is treacherous!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Thank you for lighting the way through the dark! I'm Vivica.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"I'm Lux, the keeper of the light."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"I'd like to ask you something personal, Lux."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Hmmm... Alright.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Have you forged a bond with a hero?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Sadly, I have not. I've heard it's something like a friendship that lasts a lifetime."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Noctur! I just met one of the heroes who arrived at Dragonspire.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Her name is Elena. Maybe I'll finally forge a Dragon Bond like you!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Oh... good for you, Blaze."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,She is a great fighter! I could learn a thing or two from her.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,You're a mighty dragon. What can a human teach you about fighting?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,We will see! But I already feel stronger. I'll show you!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,See! I fought a lot better! It could be the Dragon Bond.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Elena helped me when the odd weather made me weaker.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Also, an unusual horde of monsters surrounded me."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Are you telling me a human saved you, a mighty dragon?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Well, I just said I was feeling weaker and surrounded!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I was lucky Elena was there.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Noctur, what's the matter? I can sense immense sadness within you."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Oh... It's nothing...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Noctur, slow down! You know you can tell me anything."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Noctur flies away as fast as he can, and Blaze follows him."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Noctur! Wait!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Blaze, go back home to Dragonspire!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,No! I'm not going home without you.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Suddenly, Noctur turns sharply, slams into Blaze to slow him down, and vanishes into the thick clouds."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Noctur! Where did he go...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Suddenly, the mist starts to get thicker. Blaze flies frantically, looking for his friend."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I have to find him quickly. This mist is freezing my wings.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I have never seen Noctur this upset.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Noctur! Where are you?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I was talking about Elena when I suddenly sensed something shift within him.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,What could have happened...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Maybe something happened to his hero. Something terrible.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Blaze flies towards Serpent Mountain and sees a flash of gold and green between the cliffs.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,That must be a dragon! Hello! Is someone here?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Hello, young one. What are you doing this far out of Dragonspire?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I'm looking for a friend. Have you seen a mean-looking purple dragon with a heart of gold?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Suddenly, a horde of venomous serpents attack Blaze and Marmora!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The magical balance around Dragonspire is getting worse.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Everything is getting more deadly out here.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"I didn't see your friend, but I sensed a distraught dragon fly by towards Mount Oblivion."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,That has to be him!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"I advise you to turn back, young one. It's too dangerous to venture so far alone."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Thank you for the help and advice, but I can't give up on my friend."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This place looks more deserted than usual. I can't even sense any birds close by.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,That's because I've made sure of that!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Blaze senses Bonefang's bloodthirst and prepares to defend himself.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I'm just passing by. Have you seen any dragon fly through here?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,No one leaves this place without decorating my armor with their bones!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Noctur must have managed to pass through. He would never lose to someone like you.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,You must be from Mount Oblivion. I've heard dragons that live there hate Heroes.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I don't hate them...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I love seeing the fear in their eyes as I turn them into my accessories.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Noctur is nothing like you...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I wonder why he would go to Mount Oblivion. What can these bloodthirsty dragons offer him?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Woah, the Sky Palace! This place is enormous."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I should visit Lorekeeper Aranth.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I bet he knows a lot about Dragon Bonds. He could tell me how I can help Noctur.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,You! Young one! The Sky Palace is no longer safe. Beware of vicious creatures!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Lorekeeper Aranth! Let me help you defeat some of the creatures!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Thank you, young one! You saved my graying scales. I'm Aranth, the lorekeeper."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Can you tell me about Dragon Bonds. Especially if they go wrong?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,You must have met Bonefang on your way. That dragon has always had a darker heart...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Most dragons experience the painful loss of their heroes. We live for centuries, unlike their kind."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,I'm forming my very first Dragon Bond. I can't imagine losing it...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,What advice could I give my friend who may have lost his Dragon Bond?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"It is a blessing for a dragon to share a bond with a hero, no matter how fleeting."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This place is too hot even for a fire dragon like me.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I must have lost Noctur's trail...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Suddenly, Blaze senses murderous intent, and before he can react, a claw is tearing at his wing."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Are you lost, little whelpling?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Not bad, little whelpling. You deserve to breathe fire for another day, even if you trespassed on my home."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Do you always attack others without asking any questions?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Doombringer stares at Blaze.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I let you live because I respect your burning will to fight.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,But please refrain from testing me further.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Doubt starts to creep into Blaze's mind.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,How could Noctur side with dragons like Doombringer?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Doombringer was so dangerous. I can't believe Noctur would ally with dragons like him.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,The tear on my wing is only slowing me down. I need to find help.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Blaze! What are you doing here!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Lux! I'm looking for Noctur. He is on his way to Mount Oblivion!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Glad to see you're almost in one piece, my friend."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Follow me. We need to patch you up.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Blaze, you are badly hurt!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"You can't convince me to go home, Lux."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"I won't. I've seen you and Noctur grow together, and you're best friends."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,The wound on your wing is starting to fester. Let me cure you with my light magic.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Thank you for healing me. Any advice for when I finally see Noctur?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"No matter what, listen to what he has to say with an open mind. Trust that you know he has a good heart."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,There's malice in the air. Blaze senses something hiding with murderous intent.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Come out. I can sense your conniving presence!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Don't you know how to have fun?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"I'm tired of monsters like you, who like to attack without reason."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Oh, I have a reason..."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I live to spread terror!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,You are such a monster! How did you become this twisted?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Did you have a Dragon bond that went wrong?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Oh, I have a great Dragon bond! Just not with a hero."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I don't understand. What else can you have a Dragon bond with?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Oh, you naive little thing, not all humans are heroes."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,My Dragon bond taught me the beauty of terror!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"To see humans scream and run like helpless, brainless little critters is so much fun."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Blaze is left speechless. He never realized that you could have a Dragon bond with villains.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I sense a serene and focused dragon nearby. I hope they can point me to Mount Oblivion.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Blaze approaches a dragon that seems to be focused on a gemstone. Blaze waits in silence so as not to disturb the other dragon.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I appreciate your patience. May I help you?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"May I ask, what you were doing with that jewel?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"You are a curious one, aren't you?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I'm using this topaz to observe my hero and her family from afar in case they need me.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I've had a Dragon bond with this family for many generations.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Wow, that's really impressive! You're like a family guardian."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"I'm on my way to Mount Oblivion, but I'd like to know which mountain it is."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Why would you want to go there? You don't seem like a dragon that doesn't believe in Dragon bonds.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I'm looking for my friend. I think he is going there.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"It's the darkest mountain, surrounded by the darkest clouds on the horizon."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Thank you! My name is Blaze, by the way. It was great meeting you!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"I'm Ignis, good luck on your journey!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,It's so beautiful here. So serene...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Yeah... don't you just love the sound of the waves?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Woah! I didn't sense you at all.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,[Calm left head] No one can sense us when we hunt for prey.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,[Happy middle head] He looks delicious!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,[Angry right head] You idiots! Why would you tell him that he is our dinner?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I'm no one's dinner!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,[Angry right head] See what you did! No dinner for us!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,[Calm left head] It's not my fault.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,[Happy middle head] This dragon was too strong!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,[Calm left head] I bet he doesn't taste good.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,You three are crazy! Why would you eat other dragons?!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,[Happy middle head] We have never tasted a fire dragon before. You have to taste everything once!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Woah, the flower fields are so colorful!"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Suddenly, Blaze sees a dragon chased by a horde of flower monsters."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Hey! Do you need help?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Yes! These angry blooms are trying to hurt me!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Please don't use dragon fire! It could set off a wildfire!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,How does a dragon help without the use of fire? I need to think of something fast.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Your thorn skin came in really handy to damage those blooms!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Thank you for the help and for not using fire!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,It's my duty to protect unique areas like this from destruction.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,It must be challenging to not use any dragon fire.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"It's worth it. Beautiful areas like this connect me to my hero, as we share the same duty of protecting nature."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,My hero taught me that having something to protect makes you stronger.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This place is freezing! I need to pass by this area quickly.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Greetings... What is a fire dragon doing at the Nefarious Summit?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Hello, I'm just passing by."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Great, another dragon trying to go to Mount Oblivion. You should turn back."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,You can't enter without an invitation.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I can see Mount Oblivion from here.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Why would I need an invitation to enter? I could just fly there?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,The mountain is guarded by dragons that won't let you enter.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,How do you know about the invitation?
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Many return here trying to enter without an invitation, and I'm tired of rude visitors."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I must try to enter without an invitation. I don't have a choice.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Hmmm... Maybe you could enter the mountain undetected through the Abyssal Chasm.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Thank you! I'll try that.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,So this is the Abyssal Chasm. It looks really dark in here.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,This might be the only way to reach Mount Oblivion without an invitation.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,And the only way I'll find Noctur...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Blaze musters all his courage and dives into the darkness of the Abyssal Chasm.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Are you lost, dear?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"As the mysterious dragon hovers before Blaze, he can't read her intentions. Is this dragon a friend or foe?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I'm looking for another way to enter Mount Oblivion. As I don't have an invitation.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"I see. I'm a guardian of the mountain, I can't let you venture further."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Please, I'm just looking for my friend. A blade-winged purple dragon."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"Noctur. He was invited, but you are not."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Without an invitation, your fate is sealed, Blaze."
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,It seems you have a strong will...
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,You are defeated. Let me pass! Now!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"You are only here for Noctur, right?"
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Yes!
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Noctur hasn't entered Mount Oblivion yet.
story.season.dragon_s1_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,He went to Sunshine Horizon. It's west of here.
story.season.e1_province_01.0.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I'm speaking
story.season.province_10.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,Commander Grey! You are... alive?
story.season.province_10.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"I'm more than alive Elena. The Dark Lord has rebuilt me, given me a better purpose."
story.season.province_10.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,No! This can't be!
story.season.province_10.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_03,This is as it should be. You will also soon see the error of your ways.
story.season.province_11.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"So Vivica, any new pets I should be aware of?"
story.season.province_11.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,Well there was a small problem with the Frost Owls...
story.season.province_11.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,...
story.season.province_11.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_03,But the soldiers carried to the very top of the fortress were almost completely unhurt while climbing back. It's all fine now!
story.season.province_11.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_04,Right. Somehow I don't think this is the last I hear of this...
story.season.province_12.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,It appears you're not falling back. That is most unwise.
story.season.province_12.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,The creatures and soldiers you've fought against have been nothing compared to what you shall face the further you go!
story.season.province_13.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"Elena, how are the troops holding up on the battlefield?"
story.season.province_13.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"Amazingly well, all things considered. The fighting is hard, but our tactics have proven victorious when it matters."
story.season.province_14.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,Commander Grey. It is soon time for you to face your former friends. And crush them.
story.season.province_14.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,...your command is absolute. It shall be done.
story.season.province_15.1.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,Vivica! Why is there a tiny Dragon nesting atop that building?
story.season.province_15.1.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"Oh, the Owls really needed something to play with. Dragons are pretty much the only things that can survive that, though."
story.season.province_15.1.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,...right. Giant Owls and Dragons. What could go wrong...
story.season.province_16.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"The opposition is getting tougher, but we keep pushing on."
story.season.province_16.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,Don't forget to Train and Ascend your army. We don't know what's up ahead.
story.season.province_17.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"Elena, did the message arrive to the frontlines?"
story.season.province_17.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,What message?
story.season.province_17.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,The message about the new tavern that we're about to open? It's going to be great!
story.season.province_17.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_03,Hah! Well that indeed is good news! I promise to spread the news!
story.season.province_18.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"The base seems quiet. Too quiet. Vivica, what's going on? Where are most of the people?"
story.season.province_18.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,Hi Richard! Do you remember the Frost Owls and the tiny Dragon?
story.season.province_18.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,How could I forget...
story.season.province_18.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_03,We're running low on supplies and we organized a hunting party that's using the Owls and the Dragon to find more food.
story.season.province_18.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_04,"Wow, good thinking. So the creatures actually are of use. Impressive!"
story.season.province_18.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_05,Thank you Richard!
story.season.province_19.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,Grey! There must be something of your old self remaining. Something good!
story.season.province_19.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,...good and evil do not matter. Power matters. The Dark Lord shall prevail.
story.season.province_19.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,"This is almost too much to bear... but if there's nothing left of the man you were, we will defeat the monster you've become!"
story.season.province_20.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,Grey. You failed once at stopping the rebels. This is your chance...
story.season.province_20.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,...I will not fail this time. I will sacrifice all and become a vessel for dark power. My sole purpose is to destroy.
story.season.province_20.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,And our opponents will see what will be their monstrous fate.
story.season.province_21.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,We have progressed far from where we started at. The fate of the Empire will be decided soon.
story.season.province_21.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,The countless battles have hardened us into an army unlike any that these lands have ever seen.
story.season.province_22.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"Commander, you're defeated. I can see that whatever power kept you going is leaving you."
story.season.province_22.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"Cough... yes, the monster I was is soon gone for good. I can see now, in my final moments, clearly again..."
story.season.province_22.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,Grey... know that we won't allow anyone to meet your fate again. The Dark Lord will pay for this!
story.season.province_22.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_03,Thank you... old friend. Farewell... may your sword... strike... true......
story.season.province_22.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_04,Goodbye...
story.season.province_23.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,This is... unthinkable. Impossible. Your pitiful crusade should not have reached this far!
story.season.province_23.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,We have the will and might to do what no one has done before. We will destroy you.
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,No! What have you done?! I'm fading away! Aargh!!!
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,You're done for. Your dark power is leaving you.
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,We truly trashed you and your armies!
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,...this... will... not... be... the... end......
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Maybe not, for darkness tends to find a new home no matter what. But this is the end for you."
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Home at last. I think some celebrations are in order!
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Yes! The tavern is loaded with finest food from around the Empire, and the representatives of the liberated nations are on their way."
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,That all sounds most appropriate. We have earned our rest.
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Especially you Commander. Your tactics and will prevailed when the times were at their darkest.
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Your dedication to rebuilding the fortress is what kept us motivated.
story.season.province_23.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"We all are in great debt to you. There will be new challenges ahead, but now we can celebrate our victory!"
story.season.province_3.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"Elena, we meet again. It seems you've found new allies."
story.season.province_3.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"Yes, and together we'll end your evil rule on these lands!"
story.season.province_3.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,That will never happen. You're not strong enough to reach my throne!
story.season.province_3.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_03,Just you wait and see!
story.season.province_4.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"Hmm, is it just me or are there less rats nowadays in our fortress? It's so... tidy now."
story.season.province_4.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,While the army marches on we must all do our part in reclaiming the Empire. I captured and trained a couple of Frost Owls to hunt the vermin.
story.season.province_4.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,Uh... Frost Owls? Aren't they strong enough to carry a man? Are you sure they're tamed?
story.season.province_4.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_03,Absolutely sure! And they're cute as well!
story.season.province_5.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"Commander! I deliver this message to you, and only you."
story.season.province_5.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"When I defeated Elena last time, she was with the King.  I did not kill the King – I merely offered him the chance to join my side."
story.season.province_5.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,"If you continue on this path you also will be defeated. At that moment, if I'm merciful, I'll offer you the same choice. Join me or die."
story.season.province_5.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_03,Remember these words. Your cause is futile.
story.season.province_6.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,We're progressing well. The troops are on high morale.
story.season.province_6.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,Who wouldn't be? We're prevailing against the forces of the Dark Lord!
story.season.province_7.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,"Well met Elena. You seem weary, is something wrong?"
story.season.province_7.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"Thank you Vivica for the concern, but everything is as it should be. War should not be taken lightly, and the road ahead is long."
story.season.province_7.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,Very well. We here at base will do everything in our power to support the campaign!
story.season.province_8.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,Do you really think you have any hope to proceed further? Your tiny warband is insignificant when compared to my allies and minions across the Empire.
story.season.province_8.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"Our forces are growing, you fiend. Your days will be numbered!"
story.season.province_9.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_00,The rebel army continues to march on... towards their doom.
story.season.province_9.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_01,"Yes... they will fall before you, my lord. And then they will see that they must serve you."
story.season.province_9.0.onlevelunlocked.dialog_02,Like I did...
story.season.s2_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We must find the sender of the mysterious message.
story.season.s2_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,The shores of this island are full of monsters!
story.season.s2_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,And they're wilder than the ones commanded by the Dark Lord...
story.season.s2_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Let's see if we can find someone to guide us in these strange new lands!
story.season.s2_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Look, a harbor town! We may find help there."
story.season.s2_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Hello there! You definitely do not look like you're from around here.
story.season.s2_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I'm a captain and I know these waters as well as the back of my hand.
story.season.s2_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I can help you find the sender of this message... for a price! What do you say?
story.season.s2_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Well, we do need the help. I wonder if she's trustworthy..."
story.season.s2_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The message you got is curious indeed.
story.season.s2_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Where is this Atlantis mentioned in the message?
story.season.s2_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I know someone who might be able to help, though."
story.season.s2_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The man we are looking for can be hard to find.
story.season.s2_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Let us keep moving onward. I'm sure he'll be of help once he hears of our cause.
story.season.s2_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Someone has been watching us for a while from the jungle.
story.season.s2_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Yes. Instead of us finding him, the man we're looking for has found us."
story.season.s2_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Misandra! You lying sea-rat! I warned you not to approach my lands ever again!
story.season.s2_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Uh-oh. I think he's still angry at me. Lucky me that you're here to help in the battle, right?"
story.season.s2_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Tarlak! Buddy! We're here just to talk!
story.season.s2_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,You must leave now! I won't believe a word you're going to say.
story.season.s2_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,What's got him so upset?
story.season.s2_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Well, we did play a game of cards... which I happened to win."
story.season.s2_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,He lost a family heirloom in that game. He did not take it lightly.
story.season.s2_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Hmm, this may turn out to be harder than we thought!"
story.season.s2_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Tarlak, the man who was supposed to help us, is still angry."
story.season.s2_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I'm sorry about that. His people do not forgive easily.
story.season.s2_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Could we do something to show that we can be of help to his people?
story.season.s2_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I know what to do! Let's drive away the roaming monsters from these lands!
story.season.s2_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"A show of force? Hmm, that might be something that Tarlak appreciates!"
story.season.s2_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The swarms of monsters seem endless.
story.season.s2_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Let's push on. Tarlak must soon take notice of this.
story.season.s2_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,You've crushed more monsters than I can count.
story.season.s2_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,This is of help to my people. But why are you doing this?
story.season.s2_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Tarlak, I know you're angry at me. But these adventurers really need your help to find someone."
story.season.s2_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"... Misandra, your offense against us is not easily forgotten. I must think about this."
story.season.s2_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Ouch. I think one of the monsters managed to bite me during the battle...
story.season.s2_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Hey, let me take a look at that."
story.season.s2_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,This wound is poisoned... and the type of poison is unfamiliar to me.
story.season.s2_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Letting you die here would be dishonorable of me.
story.season.s2_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,The only known cure is found further in the jungle. Follow me!
story.season.s2_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The poison is really taking its toll. I can barely walk.
story.season.s2_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I do not trust you yet. But I must do what I can to keep you alive.
story.season.s2_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,A sacred waterfall is nearby. Its water heals those touched by the vile venom.
story.season.s2_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Misandra is in a really bad condition. Let's hurry!
story.season.s2_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,We are at the sacred waterfall. Drink quickly!
story.season.s2_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I'm... not... sure... if... this... works...
story.season.s2_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,She's fallen unconscious. But she was able to drink some of the water.
story.season.s2_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Now we must wait.
story.season.s2_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"If she's strong, and if your intentions are honorable, she'll wake up healed."
story.season.s2_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Misandra has been sleeping for weeks.
story.season.s2_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,It's hard to say if the poison is gone.
story.season.s2_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,My healing magic does not work yet either.
story.season.s2_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I'm impressed of how dutifully you take care of Misandra.
story.season.s2_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Misandra is waking up!
story.season.s2_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Uh, I feel like I've slept for years..."
story.season.s2_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,You almost did! We're glad to have you back with us.
story.season.s2_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"I guess I have misjudged you, Misandra. You and your companions have fought with honor."
story.season.s2_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Thank you Tarlak. It's good to be on talking terms again.
story.season.s2_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"So, what now?"
story.season.s2_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Now, I can help you."
story.season.s2_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Gather your belongings and follow me. We have a long journey ahead.
story.season.s2_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,This jungle is huge! I hope Tarlak knows where we are heading...
story.season.s2_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,What exactly is our goal?
story.season.s2_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,We're heading to a lost lagoon. It's not far from here.
story.season.s2_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I've heard that someone special has been seen in the lagoon.
story.season.s2_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We're almost at the lagoon. Get ready.
story.season.s2_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"I appreciate that we're on the same side now, but are we sure there's something here?"
story.season.s2_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Trust me. The eyes and ears of the jungle have never failed me.
story.season.s2_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Wow... this lagoon is wonderful!
story.season.s2_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,We have no time to appreciate the scenery! Someone is approaching!
story.season.s2_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Well met, faraway travelers. I am Ariel, the Princess of Atlantis."
story.season.s2_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,My plea for help has brought you here. It's time to tell you what this is all about.
story.season.s2_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Let me tell you why I have left my home. Let me tell you about the madness of my father, King Poseidon."
story.season.s2_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Thank you for making it this far. You clearly have the strength needed for what's ahead.
story.season.s2_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Indeed. Please allow me to continue my story.
story.season.s2_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I'm from the empire of Atlantis. My father, Poseidon, has maintained the peace there for centuries."
story.season.s2_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,The peace was lost when Poseidon started a war with the surface world.
story.season.s2_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,We'll continue later. I hope you know how to swim.
story.season.s2_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Our route will take us to the secret trails of Atlantis...
story.season.s2_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Cough cough! I've drank half the ocean during all the swimming!
story.season.s2_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I'm exhausted! My training in the mystical academy did not include underwater lessons!
story.season.s2_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,You're all doing exceptionally fine for people of the land. Rest now - this is not the last time we must venture into the undersea realm.
story.season.s2_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Hey princess, trouble seems to follow you."
story.season.s2_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,And that trouble could lead to real bad times around here!
story.season.s2_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Yes, this entire archipelago is in grave danger."
story.season.s2_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I find this all hard to believe... but the jungle has been filled with darkness as of late.
story.season.s2_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"The darkness might be caused by Poseidon, my father!"
story.season.s2_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I saw that something was wrong with him. The call to arms was against everything he believed in!
story.season.s2_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I fear that someone is controlling my father. I need your help to uncover the truth.
story.season.s2_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We're at the border of the Yama empire. They take great pride in their military might.
story.season.s2_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I have traded here many times. As long as I take care to follow their laws the business has been good.
story.season.s2_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Um, I don't see any signs of life here. Where are all the people?"
story.season.s2_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Someone is approaching...
story.season.s2_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Welcome, dear visitors..."
story.season.s2_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,If you would be so kind and surrender your weapons and valuables.
story.season.s2_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,We're not surrendering anything! Prepare to fight!
story.season.s2_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,You're no ordinary travelers!
story.season.s2_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"You got that right, lady! We are here to save these lands from evil!"
story.season.s2_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Brave, but foolish words! Master, we have found the Princess!"
story.season.s2_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Ahh... the Princess of Atlantis. She's here. Excellent.
story.season.s2_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,What is this? The lord of these lands has sworn to keep peace with the Atlanteans!
story.season.s2_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I'm the lord and the law here now! And you will not live to see another day!
story.season.s2_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Mitsuko! Why is the capture of the Princess taking so long!?
story.season.s2_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,My lord! Her group is much stronger than expected.
story.season.s2_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Bah! It's your duty to defeat them, not to make excuses!"
story.season.s2_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Very well, my lord."
story.season.s2_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"You put up a good fight, heroes. But sooner or later you'll make a mistake."
story.season.s2_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,It's you who's making a mistake!
story.season.s2_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,You and your boss are picking a fight with the wrong heroes!
story.season.s2_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The warlord is causing plenty of misery to the people living here.
story.season.s2_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,But why is he after Ariel?
story.season.s2_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I'm wondering about that as well. Could Kageburado and my father somehow be in this together?
story.season.s2_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The farms here are pillaged. Is Kageburado after this as well?
story.season.s2_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I don't understand why one would ruin his own lands.
story.season.s2_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Kageburado does not appear to be the most sensible of warlords.
story.season.s2_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,We need to hammer some sense into him!
story.season.s2_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Yet another village in ruins... no, wait! There's people still living here!"
story.season.s2_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Yes, but I see soldiers on the horizon. They're about to attack the village!"
story.season.s2_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"We meet again, heroes. My commands are clear - destroy the village!"
story.season.s2_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Despite my orders I welcome the chance to fight with you. There's little honor in capturing poor villagers!
story.season.s2_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Ha! We've bested you once again! And the village is safe!
story.season.s2_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Well fought! I have to withdraw and...
story.season.s2_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"No-one withdraws today! Your incompetence is beyond comprehension, Mitsuko!"
story.season.s2_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,My lord! I did not mean...
story.season.s2_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Silence you fool! I clearly cannot trust you with my armies or power anymore.
story.season.s2_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Kageburado strikes Mitsuko down with his cursed sword!
story.season.s2_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,No! This is... not... how... it was supposed... to end.
story.season.s2_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I'm wounded badly. Kageburado struck me with his cursed sword...
story.season.s2_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Dark powers are at play here.
story.season.s2_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Mitsuko... I must ask you this. Was Kageburado always like this?
story.season.s2_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"No, something happened a while ago. There was a man from the ocean..."
story.season.s2_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Poseidon!
story.season.s2_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,...
story.season.s2_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,She's passed out. I fear she won't wake up soon.
story.season.s2_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"While I find this hard to believe, it is clear that my father has something to do with the dark fate of this land."
story.season.s2_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We've come a long way through these lands already.
story.season.s2_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"The warlord is not running out of soldiers, yet."
story.season.s2_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Whatever he sends at us, we will defeat."
story.season.s2_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Brave words, my friend. Let's see if they ring true!"
story.season.s2_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Hey, something has been bothering me."
story.season.s2_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,The dark power of Kageburado seems awfully similar to what the Dark Lord had.
story.season.s2_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Yes, they share similarities. But my mystical senses find no direct connection to the Dark Lord."
story.season.s2_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,It seems odd that Poseidon would be the source of this dark power.
story.season.s2_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"True. Atlantis is a powerful empire, but our powers come from the sea, not from darkness."
story.season.s2_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I suspect we must face the warlord soon to find the truth...
story.season.s2_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We've finally reached the capital city of the Yama empire!
story.season.s2_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"You meddling fools! If you think you've accomplished anything, think again!"
story.season.s2_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"We've defeated hundreds, if not thousands, of your minions!"
story.season.s2_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Actually, I don't see any supporters for you anywhere."
story.season.s2_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"I'd say your reign is about to be over, buddy!"
story.season.s2_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,No! Never! This is not true!
story.season.s2_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I'll strike you all down!
story.season.s2_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The dark power... is leaving me...
story.season.s2_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,That serves you right! This empire is free of you now!
story.season.s2_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,No...
story.season.s2_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,He's done for. Now we can finally head to Atlantis!
story.season.s2_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,... What is that noise coming from the harbor?
story.season.s2_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I sense something approaching!
story.season.s2_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Poseidon rises from the ocean!
story.season.s2_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Kneel before the might of Atlantis, mortal heroes!"
story.season.s2_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Father! Why are you doing this?
story.season.s2_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,There is evil in the People of the Land!
story.season.s2_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"We, the People of the Sea, must attack first to ensure our survival!"
story.season.s2_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,But that does not make any sense. We have had no dispute with these people!
story.season.s2_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Why do you fight along these unworthy heroes, my daughter?"
story.season.s2_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Why do you resist what must be done?
story.season.s2_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,These heroes have shown honor during my travels with them.
story.season.s2_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"It is you who are horribly wrong, father! I beg of you to see past your rage!"
story.season.s2_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Never! My cause is just!
story.season.s2_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We managed to hold our own against Poseidon.
story.season.s2_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,He will attack again - the madness in his eyes is still burning hot!
story.season.s2_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Let's head away from the shore. It's too dangerous here.
story.season.s2_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"So, does anyone have a good idea for how to battle the ruler of the seas?"
story.season.s2_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Hmm. The Ancient Spirits of jungle sometimes see what us mortals cannot.
story.season.s2_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,So we go look for ghosts?
story.season.s2_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Not ghosts. Spirits. And yes, we must look for them further inland."
story.season.s2_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Hey Tarlak, are you sure that these ghosts will speak to us? Or that they are friendly?"
story.season.s2_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,The Spirits have helped my tribe countless of times before.
story.season.s2_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,There is no doubt of their help - as long as we can find them.
story.season.s2_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Right, I guess we're pretty far from your lands now."
story.season.s2_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Yes, we've come far. But I can feel the presence of the Spirits here as well."
story.season.s2_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,These ancient ruins are full of mystical energy!
story.season.s2_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,We're at the right place! I must call for the Spirits!
story.season.s2_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Be careful!
story.season.s2_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,...
story.season.s2_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,[#1e77ff]We are the Tribal Spirits. We've been following your quest.[#]
story.season.s2_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,[#1e77ff]You seek to stop the Lord of the Seas? Very well...[#]
story.season.s2_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,[#1e77ff]Poseidon is being manipulated by an evil force.[#]
story.season.s2_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,[#1e77ff]A force that originates from the darkest depths directly below Atlantis![#]
story.season.s2_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,What happened? Why is everyone staring at me?
story.season.s2_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,The Spirits spoke through you!
story.season.s2_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Good. What did we learn from them?
story.season.s2_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Poseidon is manipulated by something below Atlantis!
story.season.s2_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The depths hold many secrets.
story.season.s2_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,But this one is truly horrible if it can control my father!
story.season.s2_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,To save my father we must go to the throne room of Atlantis!
story.season.s2_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,What's in the throne room?
story.season.s2_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,It has a secret gateway to the forbidden depths.
story.season.s2_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Whatever is the cause of my father's madness resides there!
story.season.s2_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"So the plan is to charge through the armies of Poseidon, and then smash whatever we find in the throne room?"
story.season.s2_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,That's a plan I can agree with!
story.season.s2_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Our adventures in these islands have taken us to many places.
story.season.s2_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Yes, I wasn't expecting the tour to be so extensive. Or dangerous..."
story.season.s2_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,The monsters here put up a good fight!
story.season.s2_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,And I think there is still more to see...
story.season.s2_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,We're getting closer to the city of Atlantis.
story.season.s2_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I assume we're not going to get in peacefully?
story.season.s2_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"No, we're not going to get there without a fight. My father will make sure of that!"
story.season.s2_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"You, the People of the Land, seek to enter Atlantis?"
story.season.s2_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"This will not happen. I will crush you, and then you will pose no more danger to my realm!"
story.season.s2_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Father! I know you're being controlled! We must go through here to save you and our realm!
story.season.s2_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I must stop anyone who tries to approach the throne room. Even if it's my own daughter!
story.season.s2_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I'm... defeated. I must stop anyone... from proceeding...
story.season.s2_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I don't think he's quite right in his mind yet!
story.season.s2_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,How pitiful the mighty Poseidon now seems! Defeated by a puny band of traveling heroes!
story.season.s2_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Who are you? What have you done to my father?
story.season.s2_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Enter my realm, sweet princess, to find out the truth. Ha ha ha!"
story.season.s2_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We're now entering my home city. Or what's left of it.
story.season.s2_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Yeah, this place seems awfully creepy and full of monsters. Not my kind of home, to be honest."
story.season.s2_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,The thing we met outside the city is behind all of this.
story.season.s2_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,It has filled the halls of Atlantis with horror and danger!
story.season.s2_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Welcome dear adventurers...
story.season.s2_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Welcome to the Empire of Dark Depths!
story.season.s2_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,By the Ancestors! What are you?
story.season.s2_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Ha ha ha! Poseidon had me locked away for centuries.
story.season.s2_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"I'm Ursena, Empress of the Depths and the true ruler of the seas!"
story.season.s2_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Ursena is toying with us, sending the corrupted Atlantean forces to slow us down."
story.season.s2_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Ursena reeks of evil and malice.
story.season.s2_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"You got that right, big boy. She's a real rotten fish!"
story.season.s2_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I don't think Ursena is yet at her full power.
story.season.s2_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"I've read about her in the old storybooks, and in the stories she had almost limitless power."
story.season.s2_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,We're at a disadvantage here. Fighting underwater is dangerous business for us!
story.season.s2_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We're nearly at the throne room!
story.season.s2_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Oh, you've made it this far. I thought you'd have perished already."
story.season.s2_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,That doesn't matter. Very soon I will be strong enough to take over the world!
story.season.s2_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"We'll see about that, you slimy hag!"
story.season.s2_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,You've tainted our islands long enough. You will be stopped today!
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"What is this!? How can you stop me, the empress of the Depths!"
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"That's right lady, this is the end of your evil plans!"
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,She's falling back into the depths!
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Thank you, my child! Her dark power is no longer tainting my thoughts."
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Father! Are you alright?
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Yes, I'm finally myself again. Thank you all, brave heroes."
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"It was a honor to be able to help, Lord of the Seas."
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Yeah, it's pretty rare to get to be a part of such an adventure."
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,And to think it all started with a message in a bottle!
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Who would have thought it leads to such a grand quest?
story.season.s2_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Once more I thank you heroes. Both Atlantis and the archipelago are saved thanks to your courage!
story.season.s3_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Everyone all right?
story.season.s3_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Portal travel always makes me dizzy!
story.season.s3_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,That was unlike any portal I've ever traveled through. Raw. Primal.
story.season.s3_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I'm more concerned about this place. Where are we? And is this place a threat to our home?
story.season.s3_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Well, this place is definitely the source of the tremors we felt earlier."
story.season.s3_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I can feel enemies approaching... Touched by a dark power I've never encountered.
story.season.s3_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,FIGHT!
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Hello there, travelers."
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Halloo!
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Who are you? And what is this place?
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I am Agnes and this is my brother Bjorn.
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Welcome to Midgard. It was my portal that brought you here.
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,You really came from another world through that portal?!
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,About the portal: I have some feedback...
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,You're hearing colors and everything is spinning? It will pass in a few minutes.
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"You are here because a shadowy threat extends now across all worlds, including your own."
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Explain.
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"The universe grows out-of-balance. You are a user of magic, yes? You must have felt it."
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,... I have.
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,Please travel with us. We will explain more as we go.
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,...
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,Soon... Soon we will fight.
story.season.s3_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,The shadowy figure vanishes.
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Agnes and Bjorn, you spoke of a threat?"
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Talking about threats and dangers is kind of her thing. She's very good at it.
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I am the daughter of a Seer. The gods honor me with visions.
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,And what have you seen of late?
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Of late? Nothing. The gods are silent.
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Heh heh heh...
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Ha ha ha haaaa!
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"You don't know the half of it, fools!"
story.season.s3_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Minions! Kill these weaklings!
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Blast. We lost him. Who was that?
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,An-Windr. A servant to a dark power.
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"This ""An-Windr"" held command over our foes."
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Yes. He appears to have been given some authority.
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Ymir, the King of Ice Giants in Jotunheim has seemingly promoted him."
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,King of Ice Giants! That's a cool title!
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,He is not cool. Nor is An-Windr's promotion. It means the dark powers have become courageous.
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,That's why the gods have fallen silent.
story.season.s3_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Then we must find the gods. And hear what they have to say for themselves.
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,It is no easy thing winning an audience with the gods. But...
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Ha! You'll like what she's going to say next.
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I know a place where we can meet someone who was once a god.
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"""Was"" a god?"
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Agnes has always wanted to meet a god.
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,My interest is purely scholarly.
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,You should read the scholarly love ballads Agnes has written.
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Where is this once-god?
story.season.s3_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,He often dwells near this morass...
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Once-A-God! Show yourself!
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"""Once?"" Really. When it comes to godhood there is no past tense."
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Psst, Bjorn. Who is this weird guy?"
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Loki. Trickster. Adopted son of Odin the All-Father. Exiled for the slaying of Odin's favored son, Baldur."
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Now that the gods are silent, they do not have the power to hold me in exile. So, sweethearts, if you'll excuse me..."
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Wait! Tell us: why are the gods silent? And what is this dark power that spreads across the Nine Realms?
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Hmm... well. You definitely haven't proven yourselves worthy of that information.
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Meet me in Vanaheim. If you survive that far, we can talk."
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,He disappeared...
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,No!
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,I'd like to learn that trick!
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,"What did he mean ""survive?"""
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,"A small, furry creature suddenly jumps from the bushes."
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,I bring words and warnings!
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,A walking rat!?
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,A talking rat!?
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,"Meet Ratatoskr, messenger of the gods. Ratatoskr, I thought you'd be as silent as your masters!"
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,An-Windr has rallied an army! The army marches from Vanaheim! Alarm! Alarm! Midgard will fall!
story.season.s3_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,Not while I have a say in it. To arms!
story.season.s3_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,There the enemy army is!
story.season.s3_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Agnes! Rally your fellow Midgardians! We will see this army off, and An-Windr with it!"
story.season.s3_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"All right, Bjorn! Let's crack some monster skulls!"
story.season.s3_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,And break some bones?
story.season.s3_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Great idea! Let's also break some bones!
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"That's the last of the monsters. Agnes, how are your allies from Midgard?"
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,It takes more than the likes of An-Windr and his minions to keep us down.
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,They came from that direction. Beyond those mountains.
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Yes. That's Vanaheim. If I were a betting man, and I am, I would say An-Windr has conquered it."
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Loki offered to meet us there... But that's enemy territory.
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Our only choice is to go on. Even now I feel the Nine Realms trembling beneath our feet.
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,We must find out what is going on here! It threatens our world as well!
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"It is true. Even I can feel it. Something is very, very wrong."
story.season.s3_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"To Vanaheim, then. To find Loki and answers."
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"So, this is Vanaheim?"
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Yes, this is the realm of the Vanir. They are the masters of sorcery and prophecy."
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,... this place is alive with magic. Magic has shaped everything in it. I... I have never seen anything so beautiful.
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Wait until you visit Alfheim. The elves really know how to landscape.
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Be on your guard! An-Windr knows we are coming.
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Then we have two goals here in Vanaheim...
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Defeat An-Windr, and find out what Loki knows."
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Loki will not appear until he has had his fun.
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"He'll have fun watching us fight for our lives, no doubt..."
story.season.s3_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Then let's give him a good show!
story.season.s3_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,It seems An-Windr is not here.
story.season.s3_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"If I was An-Windr I'd want a vantage point. Someplace with a view, to watch us."
story.season.s3_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,That makes sense. Follow me.
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,There. That is the old Vanir aerie. That's where I learned the ways of the Seer.
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Oh my. I can still hear their songs, from long ago..."
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"The magic is strong here. Tell me, sorceress: what else do you hear?"
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Uuuh... I hear... I hear...
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Soon, my King. Soon your new world shall be born!"
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"You talk too much, servant. Intruders are approaching."
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"They are nothing, my King."
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Kill them now.
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Kill. Yes my king.
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"Today, Vanaheim. Tomorrow... worlds beyond number. MINIONS! ATTACK!"
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Oh no! I can see that they are attacking!
story.season.s3_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Oh YES! More monsters to smack!
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"This is the aerie, place of ancient learning. But it has been befouled by An-Windr..."
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Agnes, I think it can be cleansed. This is but a brief indignity."
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Loki appears out of thin air... again.
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Yes, the Vanir are quite adept at working miracles. Unless, of course, someone is interrupting their work."
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Someone who's a complete moron. Someone like An-Windr.
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Loki. We have played your game. Now tell us: what is happening?
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Why are the Nine Realms trembling, and our home along with them?"
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Oh, I think An-Windr could tell you all that better than I ever could."
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"No, wait...!"
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,He's gone again.
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"If he says An-Windr has the answers, then it's An-Windr we must find."
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,"In my vision, I heard An-Windr speaking with his master, Ymir, the King of Ice Giants."
story.season.s3_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,Let's push on. An-Windr can't be far anymore!
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,There...
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,He...
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,IS!
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Ha! The universe trembles beneath me, the mighty An-Windr, and you dare to challenge me?"
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,It is not he who makes the worlds tremble! It is his master who holds the power.
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Tell us: what darkness has Ymir unleashed?
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Better you see it for yourselves. Yes.
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,My king demands your deaths... I shall string you all from the World Tree.
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"You will witness the glorious horror my King is creating. He shall hear your screams, and be pleased with me."
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Do we have to keep listening to this?
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,I'd rather not.
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Take him down!
story.season.s3_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,MINIONS! STOP THEM!
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Well... you killed him.
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,He was a boring conversationalist anyway.
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"An-Windr wasn't going to tell us anything useful. We are counting on you, Loki."
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Little old me? How could I possibly help mighty heroes such as you...?
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Enough games! What is Ymir up to and how do we stop him?
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Oh please... the King of Ice Giants doesn't have the mental might to plan something like this.
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Do you mean Ymir is working with... other gods?
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,How can we stop a god? Let alone more than one?
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Do you know why I was placed in exile?
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"Please, she knows all the stories about you."
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,You killed your brother.
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,"Accidentally, not that anyone believes me. His name was Baldur, and he was Odin's favorite son."
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,"And he was my step-brother, for the record. Me being adopted and all that."
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,We do not have time for this!
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,"I think you do, sweetheart. If only you were smart enough to understand what I'm telling you."
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,Baldur was a god.
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,...and he died.
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,"And I'm only half a god, really. Demigod, at best."
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,Gods can die.
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_19,"Gods can be killed, sweetness. By regular, run-of-the-mill boring little people like yourselves."
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_20,Are you saying that we should kill the gods that are behind this all? Is that enough to stop their plans?
story.season.s3_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_21,I'm afraid you have only one way of finding out. Good luck!
story.season.s3_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Right. First things first. Do you know what ""Jotunheim"" means, friends?"
story.season.s3_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"""Land of Free Hugs?"""
story.season.s3_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"""World of the Giants."""
story.season.s3_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Ah.
story.season.s3_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"It is ruled over by the Ymir, the King of Ice Giants. Which is why this place is colder than Agnes' sense of humor."
story.season.s3_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,We have been moving toward a great source of power.
story.season.s3_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Yes. We are very close now.
story.season.s3_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Clearly Ymir does not wish to be disturbed.
story.season.s3_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Agh... A small tremor? I can sense something in pain.
story.season.s3_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Something cries out for aid. Something... massive.
story.season.s3_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,This may be worse than I had feared. We must hurry.
story.season.s3_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Vivica. You felt a great pain. From where did it come?
story.season.s3_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,That... that way.
story.season.s3_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Then that is where we must go.
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,They're beginning to put up a stronger fight.
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,There is most certainly something here that they do not wish us to find.
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Agh! Did... did you feel that?
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Yes. We all did.
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Another tremor. Bigger than the others.
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,It is getting worse.
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Agnes. What aren't you telling us?
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Forgive me. I am not being deceptive. Rather...
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Alarm! Alarm!
story.season.s3_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,The messenger of gods does not seem to be delivering good news.
story.season.s3_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Ratatoskr. I fear I know what you have come to tell us.
story.season.s3_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Ymir! He brings death to life as his wife seeks to bring life to death!
story.season.s3_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I didn't understand any of that.
story.season.s3_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Has Ymir succeeded in his plans?
story.season.s3_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Close! He is very close to succeeding!
story.season.s3_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Agnes... What aren't you telling us?
story.season.s3_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,There's no time for that. Follow me! We may already be too late.
story.season.s3_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I feel the life draining... fleeing... from this realm.
story.season.s3_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,The plants here look sickly.
story.season.s3_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,And those damned tremors. The ground itself is fit to burst.
story.season.s3_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Agnes. Give us answers. Now.
story.season.s3_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,It is enough for you to know that the King of Ice Giants seeks to unmoor the Nine Realms.
story.season.s3_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"To set our lands adrift from one another, to sail forever into the void, becoming nothing."
story.season.s3_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Him doing so will bring about an ending to the universe as you know it.
story.season.s3_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Including our own world and home.
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I bring news!
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Speak, Ratatoskr."
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,The old man bids you to hurry! The tree is dying!
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"""Old man?"" ""Tree?"""
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The tree in whose arms we all rest. The tree in whom I make my home.
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,The tree whose trunk I run down to tell you: Yggdrasil is dying!
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Yggdrasil?
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Not sure I follow.
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"The old man refers to Odin, the All-Father. God of Gods. Father to Thor, Step-father to Loki."
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"Ruler of the Nine Realms, from his seat in Asgard. From which Yggdrasil, the World Tree, spreads her roots."
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Roots which bind the Nine Realms together.
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Oh...
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,But why would Ymir want to destroy the very land upon which they live?
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,I'm confused.
story.season.s3_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,The tremors are increasing. We can talk more later.
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Tremor! A big one!
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Too slow! You are too slow!
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Look! All around us...
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,The plants ... the trees...
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Dying.
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Hurry. While there is still time.
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Sister?
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Come, Bjorn. As the stranger says."
story.season.s3_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,While there is still time.
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Whoa. Who's that?
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Is that the King of Ice Giants?
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Indeed.
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Are these the ones, wife?"
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Indeed, husband. These are the heroes that have hacked their way through dying lands..."
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,... to find you.
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"We come to save the World Tree, giant!"
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,And if that means we have to carve our way through your legions...
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,So be it.
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Heh heh heh.
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,HA HA HA HA!
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"I want their heads, husband."
story.season.s3_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,I want their heads... now!
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,What have you done? Where is my husband?!
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Your husband lies defeated. And his work is undone.
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Oh is it, little insect?"
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Or was the work completed days before your arrival?
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Agnes, look! What is that enormous, twisted wall of wood?"
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,That is one of the World Tree's roots. Now shrivelled and black.
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,So the tree lost one root. A tree has many roots. The tree is fine and we have saved the day!
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,HAHAHAHAHA!
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,I like this one.
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"Oh, insects. To destroy a universe is more than the work of one man, woman or god."
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,I shall continue my husband's work...
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,... as do our many allies...
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,She's gone.
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,She means to bring about the death of the universe?
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,Yes. Our stories speak of this...
story.season.s3_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,It's called Ragnarok.
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This is Svartalfheim. Be wary. We have no need to linger here...
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,We only need to pass through.
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,And let's do it quickly.
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,This place...
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,This is the realm of Alfrike.
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,She is the Queen of the Dark Elves... And we just killed her husband.
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,We're surrounded by black thicket. This realm is like a maze.
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Or a tomb.
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Witch! You will not –
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Silence!
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,You took Ymir from me. Now I will take something from you.
story.season.s3_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,I will take all that you have.
story.season.s3_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Alfrike is determined to see us undone.
story.season.s3_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,This is her territory. It's her dominion....
story.season.s3_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,... and she is driven by the fury of grief.
story.season.s3_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,We have but one purpose in this place: to get through it.
story.season.s3_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"We must go to Helheim, the Land of the Dead. It's the realm of the goddess Hel."
story.season.s3_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"I would have preferred a god of parties, but the goddess of death was the only one available."
story.season.s3_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,We must learn why the gods have fallen silent.
story.season.s3_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Best to ask one, then. Let's keep moving."
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The realm of the Dark Elves was not always this dark.
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,This was before Alfrike fell in love with the King of Ice Giants.
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,He was a ... bad influence?
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Lore tells us they were both good, once, but that their individual natures poisoned each other."
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Turning them into something twisted. Gone was Good Queen Alfrike.
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Then came the rise of the Dark Elves.
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,It is her very nature that has made this place what it is.
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,It is a reflection of her mind.
story.season.s3_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,No. It is a reflection of her soul.
story.season.s3_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Terror will come upon your worlds. It shall be a fitting memorial for the King you laid low.
story.season.s3_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Ragnarok! Ragnarok shall come!
story.season.s3_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"And all the Realms of all the Worlds shall drift, alone, forever..."
story.season.s3_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"... and Asgard, at last, shall be as it was meant to be."
story.season.s3_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,A land for the gods. And none other.
story.season.s3_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Do you hear that?
story.season.s3_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Alfrike's forces are being marshaled.
story.season.s3_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Before long they shall be upon us, wide of eye and bloody of tooth."
story.season.s3_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"This is her Realm, and she would hurl it all into the Void to stop us."
story.season.s3_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,I feel that Alfrike and Ymir did not plan this alone.
story.season.s3_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Brace yourselves, friends!"
story.season.s3_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,The enemy is here!
story.season.s3_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Fight on, my people! Fight on, fierce Dark Elves!"
story.season.s3_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I must leave to call upon our ally!
story.season.s3_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Alfrike is headed the same way we are."
story.season.s3_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Straight into...
story.season.s3_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Helheim.
story.season.s3_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,The Queen of the Dead is Alfrike's ally?
story.season.s3_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,We can only hope not.
story.season.s3_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Let's move as quickly as we can. So that we can ask Hel directly.
story.season.s3_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We must get to the Realm of the Dead before Alfrike.
story.season.s3_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,It is hard to believe that Hel would ally with Alfrike. Alfrike is a source of chaos!
story.season.s3_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Is Hel not the Queen of Death?
story.season.s3_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Death, yes, as a part of the cycle of rebirth. An agent of oblivion and chaos she is not."
story.season.s3_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Oblivion, chaos, death... All sounds bad to me!"
story.season.s3_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Things might not be as simple as they seem... Onward!
story.season.s3_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Agnes, you say we must pass through Niflheim to reach Helheim?"
story.season.s3_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Yes. Niflheim is a freezing realm, full of mist and dark magic. It has been a second home to Alfrike and Ymir."
story.season.s3_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,You mentioned that they were planning Ragnarok?
story.season.s3_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Ragnarok... We were frightened as children with tales of Ragnarok...
story.season.s3_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"... That it may happen now, should we fail, is beyond imagination."
story.season.s3_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Failing is not an option. Let's go!
story.season.s3_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Fenrir, Leader of Niflheim, your Queen asks for your aid."
story.season.s3_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Alfrike... the whole of Niflheim shares your grief. The King was...
story.season.s3_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I have no use for your grief, wolf-lord. I require your fealty, and your forces."
story.season.s3_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"You have that and more. You know this, Alfrike."
story.season.s3_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Those who defeated your King will soon be here. Stopping them would bring you great honor.
story.season.s3_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I shall revel in their demise.
story.season.s3_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,As you please. I have business in Helheim and must depart soon.
story.season.s3_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,And I shall gift you their heads. To keep you company on your long journey.
story.season.s3_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The battle goes well. The intruders are a most invigorating opponent.
story.season.s3_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Do not toy with them, wolf-lord. They are not an easy prey."
story.season.s3_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Fear not. We are almost done with them. Go now. They shall bother you no more.
story.season.s3_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"I thank you, dear wolf. As would your King. Farewell."
story.season.s3_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,...
story.season.s3_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I cared not for the King. Only you.
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,So many enemies to fight!
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,How many more of them are there?!
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Far more than I can count!
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Horde of Niflheim! Regroup!
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,If we do not break through...
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,... Alfrike escapes.
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,We don't want her to meet Hel before us!
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Steel yourselves!
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,In the name of Queen Alfrike! Attack!
story.season.s3_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Make the outsiders regret marching to Niflheim!
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Fenrir! Listen! Alfrike means to unmoor the worlds we all share!
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Why are you doing this?
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"You would not understand, man-thing."
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Try me.
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Had I to choose between the universe and Alfrike...
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I would choose Alfrike. Always.
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,You're right I'm not following.
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,She is without a husband. But not for long.
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,I shall prove I am twice the warrior Ymir ever was.
story.season.s3_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,By defeating you.
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Meanwhile in Helheim...
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Who dares enter my realm?
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I beg audience, Queen of the Dead. Your realm faces annihilation."
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"I am Alfrike, Queen of..."
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"I know who you are, Queen of Svartalfheim. I know very well."
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Speak.
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"The World Tree which binds our realms together, keeps us moored amid the chaos of unending Void..."
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Make your point.
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Her roots, Hel. The roots of the World Tree have been attacked. Poisoned. By outsiders."
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,In Jotunheim. In Svartalfheim. And now they come for Helheim.
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,...
story.season.s3_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Come closer. Tell me of these... outsiders.
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The outsiders...
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,They march towards Helheim?
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,As we speak Niflheim trembles. Brave Fenrir leads the defense.
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Hm.
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,You shall remain here as my guest. Until the truth of this is revealed.
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,My legions shall assist Fenrir in defense of Niflheim.
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"If it is as you say, my army of the dead shall not rest until these intruders are gone."
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Thank you, Hel."
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Thank you very much indeed.
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Someone has been listening in the shadows...
story.season.s3_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"Oh. Alfrike's good. She's very, very good with lies and deception..."
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"The battle goes poorly, but if defeat is my destiny I meet it gladly..."
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,... knowing I have done her will.
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Wolf! Do you know me?
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Yes... I know you, Queen of the Dead!"
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Have you come to aid my army, or add them to your own?"
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Alfrike told me the tale of Ragnarok. Do you know it?
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,The tale of Ragnarok... I do.
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"It is a tale all shall know before long, and the final one should we fail here."
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"In that case, I come as a friend."
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Direct me toward the foe.
story.season.s3_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Gladly.
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Meanwhile Alfrike is searching for something in Helheim...
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Where is it? Where does the cold-blooded witch keep it? Where?!
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Loki is still hiding in the shadows observing Alfrike...
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,What can she be looking for?
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Something important enough that she tricked the Queen of Death into leaving Helheim unattended...
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Ah...!
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Here it is!
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"It is far, far more beautiful - and terrible - than I imagined."
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Oh, Alfrike shouldn't have found that. This is bad."
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,The Runestone of Death! Said to give Hel her powers.
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,With this Runestone she rules over all the dead within the Nine Realms.
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,And now...
story.season.s3_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,... it is mine.
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Fall back, my Legions! We shall regroup and once more press the attack."
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,What is this? The Legions of the Dead are not following my orders anymore?!
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,What?! The Legions of the Dead are not listening to their god?
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Well well, hello everyone."
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Loki. Have you stolen Hel's power over her forces? Was this all part of some cunning game?
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Well, I can't take credit for this."
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Actually I'm here to tell you who HAS stolen Hel's power over her forces.
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Alfrike. She stole the Runestone of Death.
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,And you know this because... ?
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Maybe that's what Loki wanted to do but Alfrike got to the Runestone first?
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,A puny trickster like Loki couldn't have even thought of that!
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,This plan was possible thanks to Alfrike's sovereign intelligence.
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,Alfrike is now the Queen of the Dead!
story.season.s3_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Dead Legions! Attack! For Queen Alfrike!
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I may fall... but I will rise again...
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,That is unlikely.
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Outsiders! Fenrir has been defeated but the Legion of the Dead is still under Alfrike's command!
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,That means trouble for all of the Nine Realms.
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Yes, we know."
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,And there is more bad news.
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"The King of Fire Giants, Surtur. He has entered my lands during my absence."
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,I can feel it. He marches for the Yggdrasil Root in Helheim...
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Surtur has joined forces with Alfrike. If Ymir was bad, Surtur is even worse."
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"Queen Hel, you have always treated our dead well."
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"It is our duty to retrieve the Runestone of Death for you, Queen Hel."
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,We must stop Ragnarok. Which means need to go to Helheim.
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,"I can open Helvegr, the Road to Helheim, for you."
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,Your journey to the Realm of the Dead shall be quick.
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,"For the sake of the Nine Realms, stop Surtur and save the Root of Yggdrasil!"
story.season.s3_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,Go.
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,So. This is the Land of the Dead.
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I was expecting more...
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Doom!
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,No... skulls. I was expecting more skulls.
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,DOOM!
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Ratatoskr! What's happening?
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Queen Alfrike! Her undead army!
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,It moves! It moves against her age-old enemies!
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,The Elves of Alfheim!
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Alfheim is a realm of artistry. Of peace.
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,This sounds like trouble for the elves.
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,How far is Alfheim?
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,"Far. Beyond Muspelheim, the realm of the Fire Giants."
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,"The very name ""Muspelheim"" means ""the end of the world through fire."""
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,We can't possibly make it in time to be of any aid to Alfheim.
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,A woman with golden hair approaches the heroes...
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,"Helpful as ever, Loki."
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,Who...?
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_18,"Hello Sif. Sif, this is everyone. Everyone, Sif."
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_19,My sister-in-law.
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_20,"We are the only hope Alfheim has, and there are realms of death and fire between us and them."
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_21,"By the way Loki, Thor says hello."
story.season.s3_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_22,Great.
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"So, tell me brother-in-law, how is it you were in Hel's chambers when Alfrike stole the Runestone of Death?"
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,That was quite a stroke of... luck.
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Trickster! Thief!
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,It was luck! You were lucky good old Loki was there to witness it! To tell you of Alfrike's betrayal!
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"The talking rat brought the news, not you, you two-faced lord of lies."
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"""Rat?"""
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"If you were in Hel's chambers out of any sort of duty, it was duty only to yourself, Loki. As ever."
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Of course! You were there to steal the Runestone for yourself!
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,What? Well... I never. After all I've done for you.
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Loki...
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"All right, fine. Yes. I was there to steal the Runestone. But not for the reason you think."
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,This ought to be good.
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,Go on.
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,"I did not kill my brother, Baldur. I did not deserve to be cast from the sight of Father's one remaining eye."
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,But there's only one person who can prove it.
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,Baldur...
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,You... you were going to bring Baldur back?
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,"Odin may not believe me, the supposed ""murderer""..."
story.season.s3_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,But he would have to believe the murdered!
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,...
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Alfrike...
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Your Eternal Darkness. How may this humble servant please you?

story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,...
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Is that so...
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"My agonizing of the Elves is also a gift, oh Looming Shadow."
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,This is an opportunity that we should not waste.
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,...
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,This... this I'm certain of.
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,Burn the Elves. For your service I shall be grateful.
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,"Then fly to me, with all haste.."
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Fly.
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,Otherwise... you will suffer more than the Elves.
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,...
story.season.s3_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,"Y-yes, oh Devouring Oblivion. In all things I am your instrument."
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Alarm!
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Not again.
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Alfrike! Alfrike is to gift the Runestone of Death to...!
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,To...?
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,To... !
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"To whom, Ratatoskr?"
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,A voice she called... the Devouring Oblivion.
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,The power of life and death must not fall into the hands of the unworthy.
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,But we must also guard the Root of Yggdrasil here in Helheim.
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,We must protect the Root from the King of Fire Giants...
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,... before visiting his Realm ourselves.
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,"My husband, Thor, already takes the battle to Muspelheim."
story.season.s3_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,"The sooner we can meet him there, the better."
story.season.s3_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"There! The great Helheim Root of the Yggdrasil, the World Tree! And..."
story.season.s3_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,No! The root is under attack!
story.season.s3_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Ho. Ho. Ho. Do your work, my army of the dead. Yes. Cut away the life of the root."
story.season.s3_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,We're too late. The root is nearly severed. I feel my connection... to my Realm... dying...
story.season.s3_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,To arms!
story.season.s3_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,For Yggdrasil!
story.season.s3_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Oh.
story.season.s3_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Ho ho ho.  Behold, legions. Some light exercise."
story.season.s3_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Fight on, my dead soldiers! In Muspelheim shall we rejoin!"
story.season.s3_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,He's getting away!
story.season.s3_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,The Helheim Root! The army of the dead did not manage to completely sever it.
story.season.s3_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,But the King of Fire Giants will not stop. He still has the Runestone and most of his army...
story.season.s3_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Then we fight.
story.season.s3_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Through his stolen army... and beyond...
story.season.s3_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,To Muspelheim!
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Sif. What is it?
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"All right, listen, you both need to remain calm!"

story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I am NOT well! I am BURNING with RAGE!
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"I was going to say ""dashing."""
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,YOU would DARE to steal the power of LIFE AND DEATH from HEL HERSELF?!
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Charlatan! Thief! TRICKSTER!
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Ragnarok's approach may have shattered the wards of your exile...

story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,A FINAL TIME!
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Thor dashes away – still fuming.
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Thor! Come back!
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,"So, Odin the All-Father knows?"
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,That you have escaped? Yes. He... commands an audience with you.
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,When circumstances allow.
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_18,"Of course. For the best, I expect."
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_19,I... should find Thor. Before he punches a hole through something we need.
story.season.s3_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_20,Of course. Thank you for ensuring that I wasn't the one to get punched.
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Hel. How are you doing?
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I will not rest until this wrong is made right.
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Hel is weakened. Her spirit is tied to Helheim, and Helheim is tied to its damaged Root."
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"And Surtur, the King of Fire Giants, intends to destroy the rest of the Roots. And somehow you're involved, I have no doubt."
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Agnes. How quickly can we make it to Surtur's fortress?
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,If we are swift and Odin favors us we may reach him before he makes his next move.
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"We are to save the Nine Realms, and Asgard itself. We must persevere. We take the fight to them!"
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Then we have talked enough. Draw steel and move.
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Pace yourselves. The heat in Muspelheim favors the King of Fire Giants and his godly ilk...
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,... but for mortal folk such as us it is a furnace. And the King of Fire Giants rests deep in its belly.
story.season.s3_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Planning his next move...
story.season.s3_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"While Alfrike makes haste toward Alfheim, our heroes are taking a short rest in Muspelheim..."

story.season.s3_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Why not simply request it of me?
story.season.s3_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Exile tends to make these things difficult.
story.season.s3_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"And my reputation, well, that tends to end conversations before they begin."

story.season.s3_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,"By your leave, m'lady."

story.season.s3_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,Agreed.
story.season.s3_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,Remarkable... For once my brother and I are indeed in agreement. You are warriors worthy of Asgard.

story.season.s3_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"I have, my Lord."
story.season.s3_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I trust... he did not fall in vain...
story.season.s3_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"No, my Lord. He bought us valuable time."
story.season.s3_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Alfheim will burn.
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Alfheim is in flames! A weapon. Give me a weapon.
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Sif, do not let this wretch claim the enchanted weapons."
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Sif, give Loki a sword."
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Good Queen Hel, this toad slew my brother, Baldur. He will..."
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Thunder God, the late Baldur now resides with me in the Lands of the Dead."
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"And I tell you, here and now:"
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Allow Loki to claim the golden sword.
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"I trust Hel in this matter. Here's your sword, Loki."
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Let's save Alfheim.
story.season.s3_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,You save Alfheim. I intend to point this sword at a certain Queen of Svartalfheim.
story.season.s3_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"You fought well, Trickster."
story.season.s3_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Not well enough. Alfrike escaped.
story.season.s3_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Alfrike has not fled. She is close. I can smell her.
story.season.s3_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Alfrike is not yet finished with this once-happy realm.
story.season.s3_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,I shall take first watch.
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,All of a sudden Alfrike appears in front of the heroes!
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,And here the heroes are attempting to catch me... How touching!
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Witch!
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Speak, Alfrike. Say what you must and begone."
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Your half-brother Baldur was brighter than you, Trickster."
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Baldur learned of Nidhogg, yes. And so... Nidhogg killed Baldur."
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"And your family blamed you, poor Loki, for the death of your half-brother."
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Hahahahahahahaaa...
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Still laughing, Alfrike vanishes as swiftly as she had appeared."
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Um. Loki...
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Hel knew the truth, for Baldur now resides with her in the Realm of the Dead."
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,And yet she said nothing.
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,"To jump on us like that, Alfrike seems to be keeping very close to us, yes?"
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Alfrike is very close indeed.
story.season.s3_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Good.
story.season.s3_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"You understand, don't you, Loki?"
story.season.s3_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,You're asking me if I understand why you said nothing when it could have repaired the rift in my family?
story.season.s3_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Even though it would have restored me in my father Odin's eye? I do.
story.season.s3_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"If the boundary between life and death is not respected, life ceases to be of value."
story.season.s3_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,And the universe along with it.
story.season.s3_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Even Odin must respect that.
story.season.s3_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"You are the most majestic Queen after all, oh Queen of the Dead."
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I fear Alfrike will soon give Nidhogg what he wants most... the Runestone of Death.
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,That means... Nidhogg will become Overlord of the Dead.
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,And the boundaries between life and death will fall.
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Chaos.
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Death will become life. Life will be death.
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Alarm!
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"You're a bit late on this one, Ratatoskr."
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,They rise! They rise!
story.season.s3_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,The dead of Alfheim! THEY RISE!
story.season.s3_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Is... is everyone all right?
story.season.s3_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Alfrike was almost too strong for us...
story.season.s3_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,... and she keeps getting stronger.
story.season.s3_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,And so the border between life and death thins.
story.season.s3_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Even as Yggdrasil, the World Tree herself, dies."
story.season.s3_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I must have the Runestone. Without it I cannot bring the dead to rest.
story.season.s3_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,This is just a taste of Nidhogg's grand design.
story.season.s3_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,We must stop Alfrike. The Runestone of Death must never be delivered to Nidhogg.
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,That is Alfrike's camp. The scouts are certain of it.
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Then I will strike asunder their forces, with the mighty thunder of my hammer!"
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Or...
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,... we go in quietly and capture the Runestone before she knows we're even there.
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Unless she already knows we're here.
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,How could she possibly...?
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Meanwhile at Alfrike's camp...
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Servant...
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,The Runestone...
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,I await your gift...
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"I fly to you, oh Crushing Despair, oh Obsidian Night. The Runestone shall be yours!"
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,The heroes now realize that they might be too late!
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,Comrades! Are you hearing what I'm hearing?
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Alfheim raises alarms to the west and east. Look!
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,We're being flanked left and right.
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,But where's Alfrike? Is she fleeing again?
story.season.s3_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,Draw steel! We must catch her!
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The Runestone! Where is the Runestone?!
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Alfrike... you have failed to stop my enemies...
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,My Lord... oh Devouring Oblivion...
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,But you succeeded... in delivering that which I desire...
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Now the Runestone of Death is mine!
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,No!
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Too late. We are too late.
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Now ... my gaze is on Asgard.
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Asgard shall feel my wrath!
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,NIDHOGG!
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,There the dragon goes.
story.season.s3_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,He's off to destroy Asgard.
story.season.s3_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,There! A majestic city next to a giant tree. Asgard!
story.season.s3_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,AHH-WOOOO!
story.season.s3_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Nidhogg sends his regards, Queen of the Dead..."
story.season.s3_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,... and wishes you a swift and painful journey home!
story.season.s3_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The fell wolf is not alone! Stand fast!
story.season.s3_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Fenrir... is thoroughly beaten. Again.
story.season.s3_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,He got his power back thanks to Nidhogg.
story.season.s3_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,This is wrong. Only a god may raise a god from the dead.
story.season.s3_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,The halls of the dead... are vast. And full.
story.season.s3_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,The towering walls of Asgard draw near.
story.season.s3_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Let's move.
story.season.s3_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Asgard and the tree Yggdrasil! They're under siege!
story.season.s3_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,We're nearly at Asgard. Where is Odin?
story.season.s3_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"He's defending the Hall of Valkyries, I expect. At the center of the city."
story.season.s3_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Nidhogg is summoning another fallen god to his aid.
story.season.s3_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The King of Fire Giants. From the halls of Helheim you are summoned...
story.season.s3_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Yes. And my minions are with me.
story.season.s3_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,By the burning firepits of Muspelheim! I'm done for. Again...
story.season.s3_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Enough of that hothead! We move on!
story.season.s3_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I wonder if Nidhogg has more tricks awaiting us...
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,It's cold all of a sudden. Too cold.
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Even from death we ride to your aid, Nidhogg."
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"The King of Ice Giants! You shall fall again, as did your brother!"
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Wait. ""We?"" Ymir has a partner...?"
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Yes, meddlers. I shall fight alongside my husband!"
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Odin's beard! Fighting two gods at once is a nightmare!
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Listen, everyone: keep them busy. I have an idea."
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,What...?
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Trust me.
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,You shall not stop the plans of the great Nidhogg!
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Our faith in you, Nidhogg, sustains us both! Ymir, my love... let's..."
story.season.s3_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,... DESTROY THEM!
story.season.s3_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Alfrike and Ymir could not stop us... Their anger and fury was fearsome, but we prevailed."
story.season.s3_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"And now Helheim, the Realm of the Dead, calls them back."
story.season.s3_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Valhalla is ahead! Nidhogg must already be waiting for us there.
story.season.s3_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,You must keep Nidhogg distracted. Push his forces back!
story.season.s3_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"If I sneak past this battlefield, I can get the one thing we now need..."
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Before the others even notice that Loki has disappeared, he returns.

The Trickster still looks concerned."
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,The World Tree is dying. The Nine Realms are drifting apart. Is the world already beyond repair...?
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Not to worry. I, Odin the All-Father, will undo Nidhogg's poison!"
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Oh, Odin! The god of gods!"
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Odin, father. To repair what Nidhogg has broken you need the Runestone of Death."
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"The Runestone that I, Loki the Trickster, conveniently managed to steal just a moment ago!"
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"My wayward son ... well done. The Great Devourer, Nidhogg, shall have his plans undone!"
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"With this Runestone I call you, The World Tree. I call you,  Binder of the Nine Realms."
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,With all that I am ... with the power of the Runestone...
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,... UNDO THE POISON. LIVE AGAIN.
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"A bright light fills the air as Odin calls for the power of the Runestone.

In hands of Odin, the Runestone of Death is also the Runestone of Life."
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Look at the Tree. It is strong and green once more!
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,AARRG ... this will not do! Not at all!
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,If poison fails... If plotting and planning lead nowhere...
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,... then the only course of action left is to BURN EVERYTHING!
story.season.s3_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,"Nidhogg calls for terrible powers beyond mortal understanding.

The summoning roar echoes in the halls of the dead once more as Nidhogg grows in power!"
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,By my beard! That was a rumble that was felt across all Nine Realms!
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,You have proved yourselves worthy of Valhalla!
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I'm glad we were of help against the devious dragon!
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,It's great to see the majestic Yggdrasil well again.
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,The World Tree lives. Nidhogg is vanquished. Balance returns.
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,But we... We should probably return to our own world.
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"You leave a grateful Asgard, wanderers."
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,We shall be here to protect the Nine Realms.
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,The Realms will be here...
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,... when you return.
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,The Nine Realms are in good hands!
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,And we know the end of this adventure shall be the start of a next one!
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,We're always ready for new adventure.
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,Should you have need for our assistance.
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,New adventures ahead! We await your alarm!
story.season.s3_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,Farewell. Friends.
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Welcome. I am Phileas Fogg. My friend Passepartout speaks highly of you.
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"And I am Aouda, Phileas' wife and partner in this fantastical expedition."
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Allow me to introduce the esteemed scientist Doctor Moreau.
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,You really do find the most interesting... specimens... Fogg.
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"And this is Moreau's erstwhile assistant, Elizabeth."
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Charmed.
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"But first we need to find our Captain, who's also our guide."
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,He departed to scout the entrance some time ago and has not returned.
story.season.s4_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Then we had best find him. Lead on.
story.season.s4_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Phileas! Look there!
story.season.s4_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Blast. Our Captain's tricorn hat. He would never abandon it willingly.
story.season.s4_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Friends, it was the Captain who discovered the entrance to the Underwild, he who has met and befriended its many peoples..."
story.season.s4_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Peoples I am most... anxious... to meet.
story.season.s4_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,And the Captain learned their languages and customs. I fear without him our expedition is over before it begins.
story.season.s4_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Mister Fogg! I believe he was taken this way! I see many tracks!
story.season.s4_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Well observed, Passepartout! Onward!"
story.season.s4_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Oh Moreau. I cannot wait to learn everything about this place...
story.season.s4_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Mister Fogg, who is this Captain? You seem to think quite highly of him."
story.season.s4_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,A fine man of singular eccentricities.
story.season.s4_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Phileas is being diplomatic. Our Captain is... eccentric.
story.season.s4_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"And the Captain has many, many stories to tell."
story.season.s4_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"I thought the stories were fantasy at first, but one cannot deny that this entrance to another world is very real."
story.season.s4_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"It shall be our greatest adventure, Mister Fogg! The world underneath our world!"
story.season.s4_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,These underworld beings fight with a natural-born ferocity. Fascinating...
story.season.s4_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"And, perhaps, useful, no?"
story.season.s4_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Watch out!
story.season.s4_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Hello! Ah, you have my hat. Excellent."
story.season.s4_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Nemo?!
story.season.s4_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Fogg. Right on time. I was just negotiating with the locals as per our passage.
story.season.s4_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,The way into the Underwild. It is clear?
story.season.s4_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Indeed it is, good Passepartout. Though... our journey may not be a smooth one."
story.season.s4_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"""Not a smooth journey,"" you said, Nemo."
story.season.s4_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Have your dealings with the locals not gone well?
story.season.s4_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I believe I can answer that.
story.season.s4_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Richard points at the bunch of hostile eyes glaring from the shadows.
story.season.s4_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Get 'im!
story.season.s4_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,We're making good progress.
story.season.s4_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Those stalactites. They're massive. They must have taken aeons to form!
story.season.s4_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,The scents are getting stronger... I can smell the primordial jungle even from here!
story.season.s4_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Before we have any hope of seeing the jungle, sweet Aouda, we must first survive these caves that join here to there."
story.season.s4_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Then let us waste no more time.
story.season.s4_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"We have taken our first steps on a journey to another world, my friends!"
story.season.s4_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Hold friends! We approach the lands of the Eloi: a kind and gentle people.
story.season.s4_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Nemo?
story.season.s4_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"It is I, my friends! Returned to you once more!"
story.season.s4_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,DIE!!!
story.season.s4_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I... I assure you... that was all... a misunderstanding.
story.season.s4_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"""Die"" seems pretty straightforward."
story.season.s4_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Surely they're not still upset about the ""incident."""
story.season.s4_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Nemo. What did you do?
story.season.s4_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Oh look. They're attacking again. Fascinating.
story.season.s4_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Gentle as they may be it appears the Eloi can hold a grudge.
story.season.s4_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I'm listening.
story.season.s4_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,After many adventures the Eloi honored me with... a prestigious gift. So of course they gave me a great symbol of power: a set of musical Pipes.
story.season.s4_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Which you then...?
story.season.s4_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The Eloi and the vicious Morlocks have been warring for generations. I sought to negotiate peace...
story.season.s4_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I may have given the Morlocks the Pipes. As a token of good faith.
story.season.s4_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,The Eloi are attacking yet again! Marvelous!
story.season.s4_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Such valuable resilience.
story.season.s4_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,You gave the Morlocks the Pipes. And now they are sweeping the Eloi before them.
story.season.s4_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"They robbed me, actually, if I'm to be entirely honest. Barely escaped with my hat."
story.season.s4_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,So... the Pipes are meant for more than music...
story.season.s4_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Interesting.
story.season.s4_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Interesting indeed, my love."
story.season.s4_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I can set this right. It was never my intention to endanger the realms of the Underwild.
story.season.s4_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,We must get those Pipes back from the Morlock chieftain.
story.season.s4_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Neither side of this conflict will trust you, Nemo, and with good reason."
story.season.s4_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Chance will deliver us the opportunity to change that, Fogg. I have the utmost confidence."
story.season.s4_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Monsieur Fogg! Madame Aouda! The creatures! They are attacking the Eloi camp!
story.season.s4_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"You see, Fogg? Chance provides!"
story.season.s4_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Yes. I suppose if we aid the Eloi in this moment of need they may provide you a chance to clear your name.
story.season.s4_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,To arms?
story.season.s4_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,To arms.
story.season.s4_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Elizabeth, did you see the manner in which the creatures behaved?"
story.season.s4_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Yes. Coordinated. Strategic. Almost as if...
story.season.s4_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,... possessed of higher reasoning.
story.season.s4_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Eloi! Nemo, the mighty adventurer has returned to you in your time of need! Please keep your praise to a low roar. I have sensitive ears."
story.season.s4_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Nemo! You did this!! The Emerald Pipes have driven the creatures mad!
story.season.s4_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"It did not look like madness to me, Moreau..."
story.season.s4_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Indeed they appear to have only retreated in order to sweep around and catch us from both sides.
story.season.s4_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,They are back! We are under attack!
story.season.s4_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Excuse me. Did the Eloi say ""Emerald Pipes""?"
story.season.s4_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Yes! Nemo the Betrayer gave the Pipes to our enemy! The sound of the pipes turns the creatures against us!
story.season.s4_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"These Pipes, do they make a high, reedy sort of tune?"
story.season.s4_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Yes. They are Pipes. You're not the brains of the outfit, are you?"
story.season.s4_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Listen! Do you hear that?
story.season.s4_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Music? Sort of high-and-reedy?
story.season.s4_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,The Pipes! The Morlock chieftain attacks again!
story.season.s4_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Fogg. Might I suggest we follow that delightful music?
story.season.s4_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Indeed, following the music would undeniably lead us to the Pipes."
story.season.s4_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,And with them a resolution to Nemo's debacle - and an eventual peace.
story.season.s4_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Yes. Peace. Of course.
story.season.s4_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Oh, Moreau... it's all coming together."
story.season.s4_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The pipes seem to have a hypnotizing effect over our foes.
story.season.s4_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Oh that's the least of it. If those truly are the Emerald Pipes...
story.season.s4_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,... then they do more than hypnotize the living. They reassemble life itself.
story.season.s4_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Just think of the possibilities.
story.season.s4_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,It sounds like you have.
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The caves above. The light is getting stronger there.
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,That music.
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Such... beautiful music!
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Cover your ears! Pay the music no heed!
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,I sense movement in the tunnels around us...
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,We're close to the Morlocks. We have to get into their stronghold.
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,NEMO!
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Holy mackerel! They remember me.
story.season.s4_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,DIEEEE!!!!!
story.season.s4_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Success! We have breached the Darkwind Stronghold.
story.season.s4_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,The Morlocks... they have really improved the place.
story.season.s4_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"When last I was here the Morlocks were little more than warring tribes, but this...!"
story.season.s4_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,This is more organized. More advanced.
story.season.s4_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"The Pipes, Moreau. The Emerald Pipes did this."
story.season.s4_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Yes.
story.season.s4_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,You were right.
story.season.s4_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Let us stay quiet about this. For now.
story.season.s4_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"These Morlocks are far more formidable than you first described, Nemo."
story.season.s4_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Strange that we should make it this far into their territory.
story.season.s4_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,We do so because they permit it. Do you not feel it?
story.season.s4_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I feel like we're being watched.
story.season.s4_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,I do not like this.
story.season.s4_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Now! Spring the trap!
story.season.s4_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Everyone! Are you all right?
story.season.s4_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I... I believe so!
story.season.s4_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Sacre bleu! Moreau! Miss Elizabeth! They are gone!
story.season.s4_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Nemo! We must rescue them, poste haste!"
story.season.s4_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Rescue them? From the horde of Morlocks? Did you not witness their numbers, Fogg?"
story.season.s4_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"We'll get them back, Phileas. They're certainly easy enough to track."
story.season.s4_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,There. The Morlocks appear to have taken Moreau and Elizabeth to some kind of town square.
story.season.s4_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Moreau seems to be... speaking with their leader.
story.season.s4_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Yes. He certainly has their chieftain's attention.
story.season.s4_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Then let us strike now, while their attention is elsewhere!"
story.season.s4_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Is Elizabeth... smiling?
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Moreau! Elizabeth! Quickly! While the Morlocks regroup!
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Are... are you rescuing us?
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,How sweet!
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Excusez moi?
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Oh, we won't be going with you, Fogg."
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"We have reached our destination and we are quite, quite happy here with our new friends."
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,And the Pipes they were gracious enough to entrust to me.
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Moreau lifts the Emerald Pipes to his lips, and plays."
story.season.s4_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Betrayal!
story.season.s4_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Moreau is playing the Emerald Pipes and the Morlocks are clearly invigorated by it!
story.season.s4_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,We have to get away from here!
story.season.s4_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Stick close to each other! We don't want anyone getting separated!
story.season.s4_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Let's move!
story.season.s4_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Fogg. Aouda. Passpartout. I must apologize. My... hubris... has led us to this.
story.season.s4_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"This is a sticky wicket, to be sure."
story.season.s4_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,The Eloi are good people. Their trust in me was misplaced. I must undo the damage I have done.
story.season.s4_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,We must reclaim the Emerald Pipes.
story.season.s4_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"And how might we do that, I wonder?"
story.season.s4_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Follow the music.
story.season.s4_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The Eloi rely upon the crystals around here for magical energy.
story.season.s4_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,And now the Morlocks have them occupied.
story.season.s4_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Our duty is clear.
story.season.s4_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Let's go deeper into the crystal caves!
story.season.s4_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Look. The Eloi are harvesting the crystals.
story.season.s4_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Nemo.
story.season.s4_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Ah. My friend. Hello.
story.season.s4_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Good Eloi, we have freed some small area of the cave. Your people can be at peace for now."
story.season.s4_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Rest assured we shall not rest until we have reclaimed your crystal fields... and the Pipes.
story.season.s4_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,It will not be easy. The Pipes... change things. Be on your guard.
story.season.s4_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"I believe I have the knack for playing these Pipes, now."
story.season.s4_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Fogg and his friends mean to take them back, Moreau."
story.season.s4_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"They may have driven off the Morlocks, true..."
story.season.s4_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"... but let us see how they handle the wildlife, once the Pipes have affected them."
story.season.s4_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Moreau plays the Emerald Pipes. Elizabeth's eyes widen with shock and delight.
story.season.s4_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"What a display, Moreau!"
story.season.s4_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Yes, these Pipes have made the fauna quite formidable."
story.season.s4_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Do it again! Do it again!
story.season.s4_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Why not?
story.season.s4_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Moreau's evil music has corrupted this place!
story.season.s4_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Second wave! To arms!
story.season.s4_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,They're retreating!
story.season.s4_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"A victory, hard won."
story.season.s4_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I'm not sure. Something doesn't feel right...
story.season.s4_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Sounds from the Deep Lagoon. Not good.
story.season.s4_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Morlocks...
story.season.s4_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,... and music.
story.season.s4_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Doctor Moreau has played the Emerald Pipes and thus corrupted the Morlock minds.
story.season.s4_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Field tests complete. Now for the main event.
story.season.s4_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"How thrilling, my darling."
story.season.s4_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Morlocks! Your time has come! The adventurers are weakened!
story.season.s4_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,AND THE MUSIC MAKES US STRONG!
story.season.s4_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The traitor Moreau watches us!
story.season.s4_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,He is assessing our responses to his mutated army.
story.season.s4_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Moreau... enjoys this?
story.season.s4_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Clearly he intended to acquire this power for himself all along.
story.season.s4_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Moreau's grasp of the Pipes' magic is growing.
story.season.s4_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,And with it his power.
story.season.s4_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,We have just begun to see what he is capable of.
story.season.s4_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,ABOVE-WORLDERS! THE MORLOCKS COME FOR YOU!
story.season.s4_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,We have to withdraw! There's too many!
story.season.s4_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,And they definitely don't have any civilized manners.
story.season.s4_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,This is all my doing. Moreau has those Pipes because of me.
story.season.s4_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Back to camp!
story.season.s4_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I cannot retreat. I must undo what I have done. I have a plan.
story.season.s4_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,And what might that be?
story.season.s4_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Find the biggest Morlock and knock him flat.
story.season.s4_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"That's your plan, is it?"
story.season.s4_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Morlocks follow the strongest. The leader knows what we need to know.
story.season.s4_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Capture the leader, and maybe we learn something useful."
story.season.s4_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I've heard worse plans.
story.season.s4_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,That plan was pure ridiculousness!
story.season.s4_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,C'est vrai! What were you thinking?
story.season.s4_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"They outnumbered us ten to one. Madness, Nemo."
story.season.s4_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,But it worked.
story.season.s4_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,What... ugh. What... what do you want to know?
story.season.s4_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Free of the Emerald Pipes' influence our Morlock friend seems more... himself.
story.season.s4_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Pipes... changed us Morlocks. Changed me. Not good.
story.season.s4_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Tell me, noble Morlock, of Moreau's plans."
story.season.s4_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Pipes are life. And death.
story.season.s4_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Come. I'll show you.
story.season.s4_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Why do you lead us through these flooded caves, Morlock?"
story.season.s4_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I don't have all the answers. Within these caves... there is one who does.
story.season.s4_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,There! The ground! It's moving!
story.season.s4_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,The ground erupts.
story.season.s4_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,'allo there! New to the caves are we? My name's Morris.
story.season.s4_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,G... greetings. Morris.
story.season.s4_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I dig tunnels. Got 'em all over this place. Through things. Under things.
story.season.s4_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"So sometimes I overhear things. My tunnels share a lot of walls, y'see."
story.season.s4_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I heard about your mate. Moreau, was it? Fella with the Emerald Pipes? Yeah."
story.season.s4_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"He's gonna want to play the Dirge, he is."
story.season.s4_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Take it from Morris, ya don't want him to do that."
story.season.s4_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"""Play the Dirge."" What is that?"
story.season.s4_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,The dark music stole the Morlocks' minds.
story.season.s4_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"That was just a warm-up, if what I overheard is any indication."
story.season.s4_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Moreau played but a small tune for you. The Dirge...
story.season.s4_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,The Dirge is lament for all Creation.
story.season.s4_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Great Scott.
story.season.s4_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"And you are quite sure, Mister Morris? Moreau intends to play this ""lament""?"
story.season.s4_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Well, I was tunnelin' pretty briskly, y'understand."
story.season.s4_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"But the word ""godlike"" did get used quite a bit."
story.season.s4_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,When villains use such a word it's never good.
story.season.s4_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Morris. If we wish to prevent Moreau from playing such a... Dirge...
story.season.s4_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,How might we do that?
story.season.s4_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,No idea. But Queen Zenobia might know.
story.season.s4_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Her mind is the mind of all she commands. Every last worker and drone.
story.season.s4_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Take us there.
story.season.s4_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,What do you think I've been doin'? We're almost there!
story.season.s4_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Ah. You made it after all.
story.season.s4_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Your Highness, you honor us with your presence!"
story.season.s4_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,That... that doesn't sound like the Queen.
story.season.s4_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"You always were the more slow-witted of the two of us, Phileas."
story.season.s4_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,... Moreau?
story.season.s4_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"You are not wanted here, Phileas. On that subject..."
story.season.s4_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,... we are all of one mind.
story.season.s4_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,How... how is Moreau... an insect?
story.season.s4_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"He's not. It's the blasted Pipes. The Queen's thoughts are her subjects thoughts, that's what Morris said."
story.season.s4_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Moreau's Pipes have stolen the mind of the Queen. He speaks through her, thinks through her..."
story.season.s4_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,... and so Moreau IS the Queen. And all of her subjects.
story.season.s4_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"That's a relief, innit? Phew."
story.season.s4_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Pardon?
story.season.s4_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Well... if the Queen's mind is the hive's mind... you just need to break the spell on the Queen don't ya?
story.season.s4_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Free the Queen, free every Insect in the place."
story.season.s4_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,But of course!
story.season.s4_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Well then, it would appear we have our work cut out for us."
story.season.s4_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Tea first, though, I should think."
story.season.s4_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"That's her Grand Chamber, right there. Are you nice folk really gonna fight her?"
story.season.s4_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,We must.
story.season.s4_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,It is my belief that Moreau's spell may be broken via the interruption of the Queen's... consciousness.
story.season.s4_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,We're going to knock her out.
story.season.s4_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,If we're right that should also knock out all the Insects.
story.season.s4_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Leaving Moreau with nothing to work with.
story.season.s4_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Right. Well. I better get to a good view then. This is gonna be worth seeing!
story.season.s4_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Let me guess. You think knocking me out is going to fix everything.
story.season.s4_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Curses! How did he know?
story.season.s4_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Indeed we do, Moreau."
story.season.s4_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,That won't work.
story.season.s4_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"And why ever not, pray tell?"
story.season.s4_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Because you'll never get the chance.
story.season.s4_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Look! The Insects! They all go to sleep!
story.season.s4_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,The Morlock chieftain was himself after he woke. We must trust that her Highness will have her mind returned to her upon waking.
story.season.s4_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,And then?
story.season.s4_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Answers. Let us hope.
story.season.s4_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"We have heard the Dirge, warmbloods."
story.season.s4_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"You are free of Moreau's foul music, Highness."
story.season.s4_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"The Dirge is not a melody, warmblood."
story.season.s4_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,It is a voice. It speaks all languages.
story.season.s4_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"And, in the language of the Octopods of the Chasm, it claims vengeance. For one you laid low."
story.season.s4_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,For Ursena...
story.season.s4_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I thought we had left our quarrel with these squids far behind!
story.season.s4_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Clearly not.
story.season.s4_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,The Dirge has great power. Reaches across all worlds.
story.season.s4_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,It requires only an agent - a prophet - to be a conduit for its will.
story.season.s4_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Moreau.
story.season.s4_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"You shamed my people, felled our Queen Ursena."
story.season.s4_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,The Octopods are weak no more.
story.season.s4_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Vengeance shall be ours. Vengeance... and rebirth!
story.season.s4_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"You shall be defeated once more, squidlord."
story.season.s4_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Yes. Believe that.
story.season.s4_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,You know this... person?
story.season.s4_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,We know his Queen. A figure of evil we banished some time ago.
story.season.s4_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,AND SHE SHALL RISE AGAIN!
story.season.s4_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Oh Force of the Outer Dark! Oh Lord of the Wild Abyss!
story.season.s4_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"I, Xnolphod, Most Revered Seneschal of the House of Queen Ursena beseech you!"
story.season.s4_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I have journeyed far, to this strange realm, seeking you! I have sung your song! I have made the appropriate sacrifices!"
story.season.s4_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I now most humbly request: Return to us Queen Ursena! Whole and glorious once more!
story.season.s4_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"This I plead using your One True Name! This I plead, invoking the name... DEMIURGE!"
story.season.s4_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Hm? Oh. No, I don't think so."
story.season.s4_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,This cannot be. I searched. I studied. I made the offerings. I sang the most hidden of songs...
story.season.s4_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Queen Ursena. I have failed you.
story.season.s4_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"""Demiurge"". You called out that name. What is that?"
story.season.s4_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Demiurge...
story.season.s4_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Dirge.
story.season.s4_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,The Dirge is not a song.
story.season.s4_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,It is a God.
story.season.s4_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The Emerald Pipes belonged to Great King Lughaidh. Morlocks... stole them.
story.season.s4_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,And that was when the Great King began to fade away from himself.
story.season.s4_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Lughaidh? Why have you not mentioned this ""Great King"" before?"
story.season.s4_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Lughaidh was King of all Underwild. Our... protector. We fell to squabbling over the Pipes...
story.season.s4_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,... and the Great King faded away from himself. All his power he invested into the Pipes. For us.
story.season.s4_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"We cannot bear to speak his name, so great is our shame."
story.season.s4_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Tell me more of this Lughaidh.
story.season.s4_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"""Wise Father"" was our name for him. He built the Pipes to keep us safe."
story.season.s4_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Great King sang away the great darkness that would use us to fill its belly.
story.season.s4_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Then it seems to me that resolving this disaster begins with returning the Pipes to the King.
story.season.s4_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Elizabeth is spying on the group from a distance.
story.season.s4_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Fat chance, sweetie."
story.season.s4_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Moreau, my love, you must hurry!"
story.season.s4_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,These peasants are proving... relentless.
story.season.s4_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Of course, my dove. Hold them off just a touch longer, if you would?"
story.season.s4_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Moreau is playing the Emerald Pipes in hopes of turning King Lughaidh against the adventurers.
story.season.s4_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,This pathetic ghost of a King is getting on my nerves.
story.season.s4_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Moreau! I can't...!
story.season.s4_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Elizabeth, dearheart, I fell in love with a woman of strength and ruthlessness."
story.season.s4_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,I need her now. Hold them back. Just a little longer and I shall have this sad old monarch singing the tune we need.
story.season.s4_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,The greatest of all melodies... the one that shall sing the world to us.
story.season.s4_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"I love you, Moreau."
story.season.s4_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,I know.
story.season.s4_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,You... are making terrible enemies.
story.season.s4_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,You face Elizabeth now... but soon...
story.season.s4_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,... soon my love and I shall be so much more.
story.season.s4_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"You know, Elizabeth, I've heard a lot of these speeches in my time."
story.season.s4_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,They never end well.
story.season.s4_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Yes... Lughaidh once sang away the Demiurge... with his wonderful Emerald Pipes.
story.season.s4_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,But Moreau has them now... ... and he has Lughaidh.
story.season.s4_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,With the Pipes Moreau controls the Great King... and at Moreau's command...
story.season.s4_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Lughaidh... shall sing the darkness back.
story.season.s4_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,If what Elizabeth says is true then our first priority must be to free King Lughaidh.
story.season.s4_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"No small request, Mister Fogg."
story.season.s4_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Turn back. Or be destroyed. So speaks. King Lughaidh.
story.season.s4_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Very good, my pet."
story.season.s4_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Oh dear.
story.season.s4_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Clearly Moreau's power grows.
story.season.s4_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Hah, more than you know."
story.season.s4_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Yet we must speak with the King. We must return him to his senses.
story.season.s4_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I think I speak for all residents of the Underwild when I say...
story.season.s4_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,We would very much appreciate that. We like this place.
story.season.s4_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,It's got all our stuff in it.
story.season.s4_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"While the heroes are searching for Lughaidh, Moreau and Elizabeth are having a dispute."
story.season.s4_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Take me with you, my love. I'm tired of fighting these fools."
story.season.s4_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Hmm. Yes. About that. You know me better than most Elizabeth.
story.season.s4_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"And you know I'm not overly fond of sharing. Thank you for your aid, beautiful one."
story.season.s4_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,But I'm afraid this is goodbye.
story.season.s4_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,What? No! You cannot leave me with these people! Moreau! MOREAU!
story.season.s4_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,You wish to stop that unfaithful cur? Topple his dreams? Very well.
story.season.s4_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Listen closely, and I will tell you how."
story.season.s4_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Eerie pipe music drifts across the camp as Moreau tries to take control of Elizabeth's mind.
story.season.s4_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"""I shall not reveal Moreau's plans..."""
story.season.s4_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,I shall not reveal Moreau's plans...
story.season.s4_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,We must silence those pipes!
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Elizabeth is fighting Moreau's attempt to control her mind.
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Moreau... intends to control... The Demiurge.
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Entropy itself... given voice. Ugh...
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Elizabeth collapses to the ground, lifeless."
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The heroes are reeling from the shock of witnessing Demiurge's power. Something else catches their attention.
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I AM MADE CONDUIT FOR THAT VOICE.
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,BEGONE... OR PERISH.
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,SO SAYS THE DEMIURGE.
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Oh no. Our King. The music has taken our King...
story.season.s4_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"Free him, heroes."
story.season.s4_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Lughaidh is broken free of Moreau's control.
story.season.s4_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Heroes... I thank you... but your arrival comes too late.
story.season.s4_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,The song has been sung. The walls of the Demiurge's otherworldy prison... crumble.
story.season.s4_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,All that remains is the coda. The final movement...
story.season.s4_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,...for Moreau to sing the Demiurge back into this world.
story.season.s4_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,My friends... your King... has failed you.
story.season.s4_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Heroes, you are our only hope. Please, go forth and undo Moreau's work."
story.season.s4_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"I'm right here, fools. And I'm not alone."
story.season.s4_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Why, there's an old friend of yours, right here."
story.season.s4_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,And I'm sure he is eager to fight you again...
story.season.s4_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Moreau! Cease your infernal playing at once!
story.season.s4_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Elena. Manners. Your friend was quite enjoying it.
story.season.s4_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,What are you talking about?
story.season.s4_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Elena. Richard. Vivica. Help me. I cannot fight it!
story.season.s4_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Akkorog?! The Demiurge is trying to control your mind. You have to be strong!
story.season.s4_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Akkorog's eyes turn dark and he raises his fist.
story.season.s4_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,...
story.season.s4_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Akkorog, don't give in! We have to do something."
story.season.s4_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Ahh, I feel stronger than ever before. Mightier than any morlock before me."
story.season.s4_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Oh heck!
story.season.s4_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Akkorog, this is not the real you. We don't want to fight you. You have to come back!"
story.season.s4_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,I'm not coming back. I have heard things. Beautiful things.
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Akkorog is bruised but seemingly free from the effect of the otherwordly music.
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Ah surface dwellers... what happened?
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Moreau happened. And as a result, Demiurge possessed you."
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,You saw what the foul Demiurge wrought upon me. It is close. Close enough to...
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,A deafening crescendo of music takes form... the Demiurge itself appears!
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,The heroes witness Demiurge descend before them.
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,I'm here to claim a vessel.
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,YES! Wait. Vessel? NO! NO THIS IS NOT PART OF OUR BARGAIN! NOOOOO!
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Moreau is possessed by Demiurge's music.
story.season.s4_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,I reclaim this domain. And all who dwell within.
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"This is no domain of yours, Fiend!"
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"It is mine, but Underwild is merely a part of it."
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,My domain is without limit. My domain is all of Creation.
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Enough of this! It has been a pleasure knowing you, monsieur."
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Aouda, my darling. Maybe you should leave. Live to tell the tale of our expedition."
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Never. I stand here amongst friends.
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Then it is decided.
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Time to correct my unfortunate mistake.
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Or die trying.
story.season.s4_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,CHAAAAAAAAARGE!!
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The dust settles and Moreau seems to regain control of his mind.
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Agh!
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"So be it. There are other vessels, eager to be filled."
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,And I have all the time in Creation.
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Demiurge vanishes in an instant and glittering particles are left floating in its place.
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,It's... gone.
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,I'm alive!
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"You can't win them all, I suppose."
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Is everyone all right?
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Moreau! When you were bonded with that... thing. Before we defeated it. What did you learn?
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Only... that it evaluated your strengths and weaknesses. Its power is... beyond anything I have ever seen.
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,Uh-oh.
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,"Then we must find it, and destroy it."
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,We'll surely stay alert!
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,Well this was a journey unlike any other. I'm up for some tea. Anyone else?
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,I like tea.
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,It's been a long journey.
story.season.s4_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,Time to head back home.
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Elena, Richard, and Vivica. Glad to see you have arrived safely here in Kemyth."
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,My name is Aqeela and this is Azmia.
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,A heartfelt welcome from both of us. May peace be with you.
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Aqeela and I are the wardens of the coastal Kemyth.
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Pleased to meet you! We're so excited to be here!
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,So excited! I can't wait to learn more about Kemyth!
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"First of all, what are those huge triangular constructs in the distance?"
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"I must say, those big pointy rocks are quite a sight!"
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,They are of great importance to us! We call them pyramids. They are the sacred resting places of our ancestors.
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Pyramids! The more you know!
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Please excuse us for getting distracted, Azmia and Aqeela... I'm sure we'd have more pressing matters to discuss!"
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"True. But first and foremost, we should get going."
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,"Uh-oh, before we do that, I think I have to ask one more question..."
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,WHAT ARE THOSE CREATURES?! AND ARE THEY ATTACKING US?
story.season.s5_province_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,MROOAR!!!
story.season.s5_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Ha, we bested the raging beasts!"
story.season.s5_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I'm not familiar with the wildlife of this region but... Something about these beasts seems wrong!
story.season.s5_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Indeed. The beasts are not well. It's also unprecedented to see this many of them in the same area.
story.season.s5_province_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,We must continue onward before they overwhelm us.
story.season.s5_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The beasts you fought are called hippos. Some people also call them river horses.
story.season.s5_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Interesting, I certainly wouldn't call that ravenous beast a river horse!"
story.season.s5_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,They used to be relatively peaceful creatures...
story.season.s5_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Someone or something has changed the hippos! We are not yet certain what it was exactly, but it was definitely not a natural change!"
story.season.s5_province_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Speaking of hippos, I see more of them coming our way!"
story.season.s5_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The hippos really are everywhere!
story.season.s5_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"This hippo rampage is a fascinating phenomenon, for sure. But I'd prefer not to be trampled by these murderous mammals."
story.season.s5_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Azmia, have the hippos always had such ornate armor?"
story.season.s5_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"No, the armor appeared when their behavior changed... The timing is suspicious."
story.season.s5_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,The origins of the armor should be investigated.
story.season.s5_province_02.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Come, I think I know who we must speak with."
story.season.s5_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Who goes there? Stop in the name of the Pharaoh and be ready to explain your business here.
story.season.s5_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Oh please, Junaid. Cease your posturing! It's me and Aqeela."
story.season.s5_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"But, uh, I have been ordered to guard this district. In the name of the Pharaoh, no less!"
story.season.s5_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Junaid, old friend, you know we live to protect the coastal Kemyth! We are the ones fighting the danger!"
story.season.s5_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,But... My duty...
story.season.s5_province_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Junaid, please! Fight the hippos, not us!"
story.season.s5_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"This is not right! Azmia and Aqeela, you can't just bring heavily armed foreigners and crazed hippos here!"
story.season.s5_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"This job may not be what I had in the capital, but my duty as a guard here is all I have left."
story.season.s5_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Though after what the hippos have done here, I guess I don't even have that..."
story.season.s5_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Geez, Junaid, there's no need to be so dramatic. The hippos are, for now, pacified."
story.season.s5_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,And at least a few of the buildings here are still standing!
story.season.s5_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,That's not much comfort to me!
story.season.s5_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,What the heck you even want from me? Why are you here?
story.season.s5_province_03.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Please, listen carefully. Your knowledge of the capital city, the dynasty and the Pharaoh himself may be of more use than you can imagine..."
story.season.s5_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"So, Azmia, I take it that this mighty land is in serious trouble? And it's not only about the hippos?"
story.season.s5_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Indeed. Nowadays we keep seeing trouble after trouble...
story.season.s5_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Drought. Locusts. Odd creatures in the night. Old stories becoming true.
story.season.s5_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"People like me, wardens of smaller settlements, have seen all of this."
story.season.s5_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,But the Pharaoh has kept silent. As if none of this concerns him.
story.season.s5_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,But the recent attack is something the Pharaoh cannot brush aside!
story.season.s5_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"And your village wasn't the only one that was razed, right?"
story.season.s5_province_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Correct. We have received news from multiple nearby villages. All attacked by wildlife or monsters...
story.season.s5_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The countryside here sure is beautiful! It's so pleasantly busy with monsters to battle with!
story.season.s5_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"You say odd things, traveler. Do you not have enough monsters where you're from?"
story.season.s5_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Well, we sure do have plenty of fierce monsters back at home as well!"
story.season.s5_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,But I find it so refreshing to see different kinds of monsters on our travels!
story.season.s5_province_04.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"It is, as Vivica would say, very educational!"
story.season.s5_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Look! The royal guard Waqas approaches. He is from the capital!
story.season.s5_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Attention, travelers! The ruler of Kemyth, the father of Caiza, the everlasting wisdom of the empire, Pharaoh Ptolemy invites you to meet him!"
story.season.s5_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Say what? The phantom of myths?
story.season.s5_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Richard, please dig the sand out of your ears!"
story.season.s5_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Here in the land of Kemyth, the rulers are titled pharaohs!"
story.season.s5_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Ptolemy is the Pharaoh! And he wants to meet us! Gosh!
story.season.s5_province_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Well met, royal guard. Let us discuss in the shade. We're not accustomed to the hot daytime sun of Kemyth."
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"So, Waqas, you're a guard of the Pharaoh? And also his herald?"
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Correct. I am the fastest captain of the army of Caiza. I made haste as soon as our Pharaoh learned of your imminent arrival.
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Hmph, the old Pharaoh wouldn't know which foot to raise to run!"
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Silence, commoner! Do not insult the Pharaoh!"
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,...even if it's true that his feet and thoughts do not always move as expected...
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Let's all calm ourselves, please?"
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Of course.
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Ahem. Yes. So, let me tell you more about the blight that currently faces the Dynasty of Dunes..."
story.season.s5_province_05.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"As the sun sets, the heroes make camp and hear what the Pharaoh has for a message."
story.season.s5_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"The Pharaoh in his infinite wisdom has foreseen that Caiza, our beloved capital city, may soon be attacked."
story.season.s5_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Therefore you, the mighty heroes from faraway lands, are invited to Caiza as his most esteemed guests."
story.season.s5_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Esteemed guests? Has the Pharaoh no idea that his lands are already under attack?
story.season.s5_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,You talk of hippos and crocodiles? A few stray animals are not a threat to the empire!
story.season.s5_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Those were no stray animals! The creatures are as numerous as the grains of sand, and many of them wear armor adorned with gold and gems!"
story.season.s5_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,...armor would be at home in the treasuries of the Pharaoh...
story.season.s5_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Mind your words, Junaid! I remember you from the garrison of Caiza... you were a noble warrior, once."
story.season.s5_province_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,But speaking or even thinking ill of the Pharaoh shows just how low you have sunk!
story.season.s5_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"The heroes learn that in addition to the mysterious monster attacks, there is another danger. The people of Kemyth are also divided from within."
story.season.s5_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Yes, we've witnessed that too! Our new friends have done nothing but argue among themselves for the last few days."
story.season.s5_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"It is quite tiresome, I say. There clearly is something amiss in these lands..."
story.season.s5_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,But we can't make heads or tails out of this while everyone is at each other's throats!
story.season.s5_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"As the heroes approach a river, they notice a pair of curious characters in a heated discussion."
story.season.s5_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"The riverlands are my area, not yours! You are a mere spirit of water!"
story.season.s5_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Bah! You are a flea-ridden third tier deity at best! You have no power here!
story.season.s5_province_06.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Oh no... This day just keeps getting worse by the minute...
story.season.s5_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"These lands are mine to look after! Mine, I say!"
story.season.s5_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,The river gives life to all of the lands here. And I'm the spirit of the river!
story.season.s5_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Bennu is one of the oldest gods protecting our lands, surely his claim is more rightful."
story.season.s5_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,But why would Bennu meddle with the workings of a spirit of the river?
story.season.s5_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Their quarrel, no matter who is right, is causing problems here..."
story.season.s5_province_07.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Look! The more they bicker, the more monstrous the local creatures become!"
story.season.s5_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Why are Bennu and El Naddaha both attacking us? Gods are supposed to be on our side!
story.season.s5_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Hah, I'm not surprised. Not in the slightest!"
story.season.s5_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,We have plenty of experience with gods and deities not behaving nicely.
story.season.s5_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Indeed, on our travels it is more of a rule than an exception that mighty and supposedly wise beings tend to resort to aggression."
story.season.s5_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,But fear not! There's no problem that my hammer hasn't been able to solve!
story.season.s5_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Yes, well, the real solutions always require wisdom and diplomacy. But to get there we may have to defend ourselves."
story.season.s5_province_07.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Right now it's definitely the latter. Let's defend ourselves by dashing headfirst into battle!
story.season.s5_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,So what exactly is going on here... Why would El Naddaha leave her river?
story.season.s5_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,She's the spirit of the river. She embodies the beauty of the flowing river... But rivers can also be dangerous.
story.season.s5_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Yes, both rivers and El Naddaha herself can be very dangerous! The rumours say that El Naddaha has sometimes lured people into the river's currents!"
story.season.s5_province_08.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"But what could have caused her to rage like this? And why involve Bennu, a peaceful deity?"
story.season.s5_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I still can't believe this! The great Bennu and El Naddaha are fighting each other?
story.season.s5_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,And against us! Don't forget that they lash out to everyone nearby.
story.season.s5_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"I can see that, Junaid. I can also see that you still fight well, despite having left the Pharaoh's guard years ago."
story.season.s5_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,One does not forget the skills acquired in service.
story.season.s5_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Hmm. I may have judged you wrong. While you look like a washed out village guard nowadays, there may be more to you than what meets the eye."
story.season.s5_province_08.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"I sure hope so. If any of us is weak, we'll surely all perish on this journey!"
story.season.s5_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Curses! The stupid bird and the no-less stupid river lady are no closer to settling their differences!
story.season.s5_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Watch what you say! Our gods are not stupid! But it is true that their actions make no sense...
story.season.s5_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,It's as if they could not hear each other.
story.season.s5_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Would they hear us better?
story.season.s5_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"What? You mean that instead of fighting them, we'd try to talk to them?"
story.season.s5_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,That's the only thing we haven't tried so far.
story.season.s5_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Yes. This just might work...
story.season.s5_province_09.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Very well. Like you said, we have already exchanged quite a few punches with them... Let us see if we could get a chance to exchange some words!"
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"After fighting Bennu and El Naddaha once more, the heroes finally get a chance to talk to them..."
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Gods! Spirits! Please lend us your ear and hear what we have to say!
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,What's this? A human has something to say?
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,This is curious. For some reason I can hear this human clearer than the beaked idiot.
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"You're the essence of our land, and now we ask you to set aside your fight!"
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Strange and frightful events are happening everywhere in our beloved empire.
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"You both, together, have the power to pacify the monsters in the riverlands."
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Please, look around and see the chaos that engulfs your beautiful rivers and plentiful fields!"
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,...
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,...
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Is it sense I see returning to their eyes?
story.season.s5_province_09.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,Or are they too far in their haze of anger?
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The two gods return to their senses.
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Thank you for your work, heroes. We were right to call for your aid."
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Mystifying. It was as if a spell was binding me. Blinding me from reason.
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Concerning. The jubilee, could this be? But first, let us tend to the wreckage."
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Our lands are being ravaged. There is something awry. Please help us.
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Naturally. By my power, the river beasts' rage should slowly subside."
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,But I sense my quarrel with dear Bennu was not the source of this chaos — merely a symptom.
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Precisely. Head to the west, little ones. There awaits your guide."
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,West is where the old abandoned tombs are. No one would be there. A guide...?
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Isn't the way to the Pharaoh to the east? We'd be taking a detour.
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,It would be wise to heed Bennu's guidance. I can inform the Pharaoh of the delay.
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"Good. Azmia, I will head back to help our people. Continue on with the heroes."
story.season.s5_province_10.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,"All right. Stay safe. We'll get to the bottom of this, no doubt."
story.season.s5_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The group reaches the tombs.
story.season.s5_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Mighty heroes, I will now head to Caiza to brief the Pharaoh. He shall await you there."
story.season.s5_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Of course. We'll head over to the capital once we're done here.
story.season.s5_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Splendid. We will prepare a welcoming feast befitting your arduous journey.
story.season.s5_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,You don't say!
story.season.s5_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"It was good to see you alive and well, Junaid. May our paths cross again beneath the sun."
story.season.s5_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,...likewise.
story.season.s5_province_10.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Let's head inside. I wonder who our guide might be... and why they're waiting for us in an abandoned tomb.
story.season.s5_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,These tombs are fascinating... but very unsettling. I feel uneasy.
story.season.s5_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Abandoned it may be, the layout looks pretty standard. I wouldn't worry that much."
story.season.s5_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Could really use some torches, though. And I'm no big fan of these scarabs."
story.season.s5_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Hold up! Do you see that cat over there — at the far end?
story.season.s5_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,What cat? I can't see anything.
story.season.s5_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"I think it's telling us to follow that way! Come on, let's catch up to it."
story.season.s5_province_11.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Wait! Don't rush ahead so recklessly!
story.season.s5_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Richard, what do you have to say for yourself?"
story.season.s5_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,You led us straight into a pack of enemies! Those cats were mummies!
story.season.s5_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Look, I'm really sorry! But I swear the cat I saw was different. It wasn't a mummy."
story.season.s5_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,All we've been doing here is fighting monsters. Why did Bennu tell us to go this way?
story.season.s5_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,I'm sure we'll get to know soon. Have faith — his guidance has never led us astray.
story.season.s5_province_11.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Not much use in talking now. Let's head onwards.
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Interesting! This part of the tomb is lit with torches.
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,It shouldn't be. Someone has been here recently. Stay on your guard.
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,A stocky figure emerges from the shadows at the far end of the hall.
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,In the name of the Pharaoh... state who you are... or else! I have... um... weapons!
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Wait, I recognize that voice. Could it be... Hey Jarif, is that you?"
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"AZMIA? JUNAID? Hurrah! Blessed be, I'm saved! Uh... who are these foreigners?"
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"What on earth are you doing here, of all places? Shouldn't you be in Caiza?"
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,I heard there might be an Amulet here that could rejuvenate Pharaoh Ptolemy...
story.season.s5_province_12.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Let's catch up later! More monsters are coming this way. Raise your blades!
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Praise the sun... I might have starved to death if you all hadn't found me.
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,You silly scribe. Azmia or I could have come along if you had just told us.
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"What were you thinking, coming here all by yourself? So reckless! As always!"
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"He doesn't look warworn at all, though. How did he reach this part of the tombs?"
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Some mysterious shadow kept leading monsters away from my path. It was eerie!
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Wait. Did the shadow look like a cat?
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Now that I think about it, yes. It very well might have been a cat."
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,I TOLD YOU THERE WAS A CAT!
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Mind the acoustics, Richard! My ears are ringing."
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"Anyway, I guess you were right, Azmia. Bennu did send us here for a reason."
story.season.s5_province_12.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"Not to sound too much like that fine gentleman, but — I told you!"
story.season.s5_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"The group nears the exit, but monsters continue to chase after them."
story.season.s5_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Curses. Why aren't they sticking to their territory?
story.season.s5_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,It may be due to the Amulets we're carrying. I believe they naturally attract monsters.
story.season.s5_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,No complaints from me! More things to smash with my hammer!
story.season.s5_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,I'm just glad we're not fighting hippos anymore. I wouldn't want to be in an underground tomb with one.
story.season.s5_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,All thanks to El Naddaha. Now they're probably relaxing somewhere in the rolling meadows above us.
story.season.s5_province_13.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Or swimming in the river. Anyway, let's press on and get out of here. To greener pastures."
story.season.s5_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,A group of gods have been closely watching the group's journey through Kemyth.
story.season.s5_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Impressive. The little ones from the otherworld are doing well... almost too well.
story.season.s5_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Nay! Their first true test draws nigh. Few mortals can match Papyros, let alone Sobek."
story.season.s5_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Perhaps. Those fell beings will not yield easily. Yet I expect the mortals to overcome.
story.season.s5_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Verily. Much lies ahead, but they have begun scratching the surface of this jubilee."
story.season.s5_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Indeed. Speaking of scratching — where has Bastet gone off to?
story.season.s5_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Curious. Some moons ago she ambled out for a stroll. I presume she is still away.
story.season.s5_province_13.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Fascinating...
story.season.s5_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"I think we've seen the last of those tomb monsters. Good work, everyone!"
story.season.s5_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Wait, look! More enemies up ahead."
story.season.s5_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,No... How? This is the Pharaoh's very own forest. No foe should set foot here!
story.season.s5_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I can't believe this. What on earth is happening to Kemyth?
story.season.s5_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"These heretics have been wreaking havoc in this area for some time now, sadly."
story.season.s5_province_14.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,This doesn't look good. These enemies look trained. Let's proceed with caution.
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Impossible! No mortal should withstand the might of my Sand Golems.
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,INCREDIBLE! You heroes have done what even the Pharaoh's guards could not!
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,So that's how low the guards have sunk. Pathetic. No wonder nothing gets done.
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Junaid, I know you never listen, but MIND YOUR TONGUE in front of officials!"
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Especially in front of such esteemed foreign guests! Oh, if only Waqas was here!"
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Hey gang, I think this bad guy has something dramatic to say."
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Riffraff! You will be no match for Sobek. Go on ahead and find out for yourselves.
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,We sure will.
story.season.s5_province_14.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,That wasn't very dramatic at all!
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"I'm glad we're making good progress, but I'm starting to miss my boys back home."
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"I miss my daughter too, but I'm sure Aqeela's taking real good care of everyone."
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Oh I'm not worried, I know how good she is with kids. Just feeling a bit homesick."
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Hey Junaid, if you don't mind me asking, why did you leave the Pharaoh's guard?"
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,It's a long story.
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,It's a VERY long story! And you wouldn't want the full version!
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"To put it simply, I lost faith in the kingdom and decided to protect my people myself."
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,I must admit Kemyth is going through very dark times. But I believe the Pharaoh can lead us back to glory.
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"As usual, we'll agree to disagree. Respectfully, of course."
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Halt — enemies ahead! These must be Sobek's forces.
story.season.s5_province_15.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Well, once more from the top!"
story.season.s5_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Splendid! You mongrels know how to fight! Especially you with the hammer!
story.season.s5_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,That wasn't too bad a workout.
story.season.s5_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Such spectacular power! I'm sure that with your help, Caiza will withstand any assault!"
story.season.s5_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,False! You fools are late. The hour is nigh! Kemyth will soon return to its true owners!
story.season.s5_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,The people?
story.season.s5_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,HA! Mortal — I shall recount your jape for centuries to come! Well done! AHAHAHA!
story.season.s5_province_15.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Hurry, let's move while he's busy laughing. We've almost reached the capital!"
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The group reaches the outskirts of Caiza.
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Halt! In the name of the — wait, JARIF? Why are you all the way out here?"
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Good to see you again, Waqas! Long story. Let us lead our guests to the city first."
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Of course. Mighty heroes, allow me to welcome you to Caiza! You have truly arrived just in time!"
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,We have just been informed that an invasion is imminent. The enemy approaches. We ask for your aid!
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Waqas hurriedly leads the group to the city entrance guarded by Cleopatra and her troops.
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"HALT! What is this, Waqas? Who are these pale-faced infidels of outlandish garb?"
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Your benevolence, Lady Cleopatra! Please allow me to exp–"
story.season.s5_province_16.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,GUARDS! SEIZE THE INTRUDERS!
story.season.s5_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,My apologies. I had not known you were esteemed guests of the Pharaoh.
story.season.s5_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Any fault is mine and mine alone, Lady Cleopatra! It is I who have failed to inform you beforehand!"
story.season.s5_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,No hard feelings — I respect vigilance. Your city's security seems to be in good hands.
story.season.s5_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Normally, yes. Now, not quite. We are in urgent need of mighty warriors such as yourselves."
story.season.s5_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Waqas briefed us on the situation! Let's hurry inside and make preparations.
story.season.s5_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Absolutely! Please follow me to the barracks. I shall atone for my failure afterwards.
story.season.s5_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"By any chance, would any of you have seen a certain cat on your way here?"
story.season.s5_province_16.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,You don't say!
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,A horde of enemies storm Caiza on all fronts. An undead ruler leads the army.
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Guards! The invaders have arrived!
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Noble heroes, forgive my welcome being cut short. It seems as if the blight has finally reached Kemyth."
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Your Highness, with all due respect, the blight already had –"
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"This is NOT the time, Junaid! Come on, let's move!"
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Everyone, to your positions!"
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Your true queen has at last arrived! People of Kemyth, surrender your arms!"
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Could that be... no, impossible! The late Pharaoh Ahhotep?... How could this be?"
story.season.s5_province_17.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,CHARGE! The sun smiles upon our blades! Those who resist shall not be spared!
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Ahhotep's army suffer a heavy defeat and begin to disperse.
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,The enemies are retreating!
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,YOU SCUM WILL PAY FOR YOUR TREACHERY!
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"I fear they may return, but a win is a win, even if we have also suffered losses."
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"And we'll be better prepared next time. Thank you once again for your aid, heroes."
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Kemyth is forever in your debt, valiant heroes! The sun smiles eternal upon you."
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"As both belated welcome and victory celebration, let us head towards the farmlands for a grand feast!"
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,That sounds wonderful!
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,I shall stay in the city and attend to any urgent administrative matters that may arise. Jarif?
story.season.s5_province_17.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"At your service, Lady Cleopatra. Please enjoy yourselves at the feast, everyone!"
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This is the best meal I've ever had! And we've had food in five different worlds!
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I'll say! I LIVE here and I've never even seen half of what's on these tables.
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,It is a shame Lady Cleopatra could not come.
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"I'm quite taken with her. Few royals we've met have been so vigilant, fierce, and responsible."
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,That sentiment is widely shared. I believe she may now be ready to lead Kemyth back to glory.
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Your... Highness?
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Dark times have fallen upon the kingdom these past few years. Rulers must take responsibility.
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,My mind has dulled... The gods have grown further away. Perhaps that itself had been a message...
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Your Highness! Apologies for interrupting the festivities, but enemies are storming the premises!"
story.season.s5_province_18.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,To arms! Protect the Pharaoh!
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"That mummy queen is pretty persistent, huh? Mounting a second attack with only stragglers..."
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Feeble as my mental faculties may be, I do not believe all this is her doing."
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Your Highness, could there be traitors within Caiza? Treason must be punished with death!"
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,No Pharaoh would willingly return from the afterlife just to rule again... I fear the gods may be involved.
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Far to the east there lies a secluded pyramid of great sacral import. Answers may be found there.
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Faiez! Get over here. Can you guide these guests of the Pharaoh to the royal pools?
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Yes, m'lord."
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"They are mighty warriors, so safety won't be a concern. You need not follow them beyond the pools."
story.season.s5_province_18.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Right sir. Esteemed guests, please follow me this way."
story.season.s5_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"As the falcon flies, the royal pools aren't very far away. But by foot the journey is quite roundabout."
story.season.s5_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"If I remember correctly, we'd need to trek all the way to Sunrise Falls and circle around the waterfall."
story.season.s5_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Correct sir. The exact route changes a bit every year due to flooding season, but we always circle the falls."
story.season.s5_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"How have things been in Caiza proper? We're from the port area. You've heard about the hippos, right?"
story.season.s5_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Tell me about it, ma'am. Those hippos were here as well. Not to mention all the bandits and monsters."
story.season.s5_province_19.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"It's a long way to Sunrise Falls, right? Plenty of time to share our tales of misery on the road."
story.season.s5_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,There had been murmurs in Caiza about three mighty heroes coming to our aid. I see the rumors were true!
story.season.s5_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Nah, these foes were nothing compared to... what was his name... that crocodile guy with the blades?"
story.season.s5_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I think you mean Sobek?
story.season.s5_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Sobek... SOBEK? How? I can't believe there were mortals who can even take on the gods' wrath.
story.season.s5_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"I know it sounds unlikely, but it's true. We've travelled together all the way from the port."
story.season.s5_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Bennu, El Naddaha, Papyros... We've fought against quite a number of deities here already, haven't we?"
story.season.s5_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"And crazed hippos, and mummy cats, and an undead pharaoh. Haven't had a moment to relax."
story.season.s5_province_19.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Wow. I do love tending to my batch of crops, but in times like these, I wish I were an adventurer!"
story.season.s5_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Ugh. I'm still in shock from seeing — the late Pharaoh Ahhotep, was it? Undead... like that."
story.season.s5_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Same! And it didn't feel like any sorcery was involved. I couldn't detect any magic at all. It was eerie!
story.season.s5_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Pharaoh Ptolemy is right. First the royal armor on the hippos, now this — no mortal could do such things."
story.season.s5_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,But I don't understand what a god would have to gain from doing such things.
story.season.s5_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Draped in blindingly bright sunlight, a falcon-headed figure suddenly materializes in front of the group."
story.season.s5_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Halt! Long have I awaited your arrival.
story.season.s5_province_20.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Could it possibly be... no! Horus the Great!
story.season.s5_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Splendid! You have proven yourselves worthy of the challenges ahead.
story.season.s5_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"To meet Horus the Great in person... As a guard of Kemyth, no greater honor exists. My life is complete."
story.season.s5_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Heed! These glorious lands have lately been marred with chaos — you all know this well.
story.season.s5_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Harmony. Order. These glories of the sun must be restored. Find and defeat the instigator of this disarray.
story.season.s5_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Set! His infamy precedes him. A feeble foe he is not. Yet neither is he insurmountable. Let him learn that.
story.season.s5_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"It will be done. We swore to protect our land against any threat, against any odds. So... even against gods."
story.season.s5_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Please watch over us as we journey onwards.
story.season.s5_province_20.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Superb. Worry not — you will feel the presence of my eye.
story.season.s5_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Erm... sorry if this is something we should be aware of, but who is this ""Set""?"
story.season.s5_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Goodness, don't apologize — we don't expect outlanders to know all about our gods! That'd be silly."
story.season.s5_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Horus and Set are enemies. Their feud started long before I was even born. It seems it's still going strong
story.season.s5_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Set is a rogue god who often seeks to wreak havoc. Horus the Great protects Kemyth and its people.
story.season.s5_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Well, we have plenty of experience fighting rogue deities. Feels like we're always meeting more of them."
story.season.s5_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Another falcon-headed figure suddenly emerges from the shade of a nearby dune.
story.season.s5_province_21.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Hmm? Here already? How grand! Such swiftness!
story.season.s5_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Excellent! You're just as capable as Horus described — and I had hoped.
story.season.s5_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Uh, so you're one of the good ones, right?"
story.season.s5_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Alas! Unbearably reductive — it seems your intellect lags far behind your strength.
story.season.s5_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Good? Evil? Such ideas are but mortal fables. I assume you ask whether I oppose Set? That, I do."
story.season.s5_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,If I may — Horus the Great tasked us with stopping Set. May we ask you to bless us with your wisdom?
story.season.s5_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Pharaoh Ptolemy advised us to head to the secluded pyramid. Would we be right in staying our course?
story.season.s5_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Ptolemy? An intriguing piece of information. Perhaps he was of sounder mind than we had judged...
story.season.s5_province_21.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Proceed! Continue as instructed by your ruler. More will be unveiled to you as you head onward.
story.season.s5_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"The terrain around these parts changed a lot since my last visit. Granted, it was some time ago, but still."
story.season.s5_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Sounding like an old man again, Junaid. But true, we would've gotten lost or hurt had Faiez not been here."
story.season.s5_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Or have wasted a lot of time by not taking as many shortcuts as we did!
story.season.s5_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Suggesting a such great guide was a rare moment of wisdom from Waqas. Thank you for coming, Faiez."
story.season.s5_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Nothing doing, sir. Not much left to go — we're almost at the oasis now. It's just a few dunes over."
story.season.s5_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"By the way, word is that new types of scarabs have been seen here recently. Wonder if we'll get to see any!"
story.season.s5_province_22.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Let's proceed with caution.
story.season.s5_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"We've met all sorts of enemies, but sticky exploding beetles? I don't recall facing things like these before."
story.season.s5_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"I don't think so, either. Well, at least they seemed to be weak to your healing spells. Good to know."
story.season.s5_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Many Kemythian scarabs have incredible, almost magical properties. Even to us, they're largely a mystery."
story.season.s5_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"So you're saying it's a feature, not a bug!"
story.season.s5_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,The explosions aren't what surprised me. Scarabs aren't supposed to be this hostile. Something's wrong.
story.season.s5_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"I wonder why the enemy leader we faced didn't breathe a word, unlike all the other bosses we've fought."
story.season.s5_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Is that... bugging you? Heh heh.
story.season.s5_province_22.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Go away, Richard."
story.season.s5_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"At last! So we've reached the edge of the oasis area — wait, what's going on?"
story.season.s5_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"So many scarabs... they're just swarming all over the place. And they look vicious. This isn't normal, right?"
story.season.s5_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Definitely not. What a bizarre sight. Guess we'll have to fight our way through all that to get to the pools.
story.season.s5_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,It seems nowhere is safe from the blight. At this point I'm starting to miss fighting off crazy hippos.
story.season.s5_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"I'll say. I'm pretty good with bugs, but even for me this is a bit on the hideous side."
story.season.s5_province_23.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Well, all the more reason to take Set down as soon as possible. Let's get going."
story.season.s5_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Exceptional. Judging from our spar, you should be able to cut a way through without too much trouble."
story.season.s5_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"This... infestation. It isn't your doing, right? It didn't seem like you were trying to set those beetles on us."
story.season.s5_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Correct. They no longer respond well to orders. A malign influence swirls around them, like a sandstorm."
story.season.s5_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Beware! For now, I can contain them to this area. But not forever. Once they escape... death will follow."
story.season.s5_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Scoratek — you must have met him on your way here. He, too, has been inflicted. Did he cause harm?"
story.season.s5_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Not much! He wasn't much of a talker, though."
story.season.s5_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Encouraging. Now, head onwards while the sun still shines. You will not want to be here when it gets dark."
story.season.s5_province_23.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,I can definitely see why!
story.season.s5_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Thank the gods! At least the Pharaoh's two pools are safe from the scarabs. The outpost looks intact, too!"
story.season.s5_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Couldn't be more grateful to Khepri for keeping those things locked down there. Always looking out for us.
story.season.s5_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Imagine if they make their way to a village. We need to find Set before they can escape Khepri's control.
story.season.s5_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Anyway, thank you for guiding us here, Faiez. How will you be returning to Caiza? Surely not now, alone?"
story.season.s5_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,No worries about me! I've guided others here before. I will stay at the outpost and wait for the next patrol.
story.season.s5_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"It was a great honor to guide you all, if only for a short while. Kemyth's fate seems to lie in your hands."
story.season.s5_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"We'll do what we can. Hope to see you again, Faiez. And please send Waqas our warmest regards."
story.season.s5_province_24.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"...although that'll only go to his head. Anyway, let's continue onwards. I think the pyramid was — this way."
story.season.s5_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,HA! Once again you mongrels prove to be entertaining! GREATLY entertaining! You may pass!
story.season.s5_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"I certainly wasn't expecting to see you again! But thanks for letting us pass, I guess?"
story.season.s5_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Why did you follow us all the way here? Are you trying to slow us down? Are you in alliance with Set?
story.season.s5_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"""Alliance""? Another one of your silly human constructs. Strong gods have no use for such pacts!"
story.season.s5_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Foolish! You can band together all you want. Even a mere titan could easily crush at least thirty mortals!
story.season.s5_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Well, actually —"
story.season.s5_province_24.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"He said we can pass and we're in a hurry! Come on, let's just move on before he changes his mind."
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Hold up. Someone's waving at us from under that tree. Probably not a foe, but let's approach with caution."
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Near the base of the mountain, the group find a very familiar face waiting for them."
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"AQEELA? Well, I'll be! How did you get here? Is everyone back home alright? Are the hippos gone?"
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Things are back to normal near the port, thanks to El Naddaha's protection and everyone's hard work."
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,I also stopped by Caiza on my way here and heard all about your exploits. You're all considered heroes.
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Well, that's nice to hear!"
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,How did you get here so quickly all the way from the port? It took ages for us to get here just from Caiza!
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Boats started running again after the hippos calmed down. Anyway, I heard the Pharaoh told you to —"
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Head to the secluded pyramid, right. But it's been long since I've been there last, so the road's unclear."
story.season.s5_province_25.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Looks like I came back just in time. I happen to know this area pretty well. I'll lead the way.
story.season.s5_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Bit of a hike this is! We're still far off the peak. Haven't gone up a real mountain in quite a while.
story.season.s5_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,At least there's this very well-marked road. I assume we can stick to it all the way?
story.season.s5_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Actually no. People have been known to go missing on this road. I'd say we're already in danger.
story.season.s5_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,There's a hidden shortcut up ahead. Going that way will be less risky. I'll go check if the path's still intact.
story.season.s5_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Aqeela sprints ahead alone. The rest of the group follow her lead.
story.season.s5_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Aqeela's always been knowledgeable, but how is she this well acquainted with this... middle-of-nowhere?"
story.season.s5_province_25.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,I'll say! I have no idea at all.
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"The terrain's a bit rough, but we seem to be saving quite some time by going this way."
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"And the view's very nice! Thanks for taking us this way, Aqeela."
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,The tough part's almost over. Not much left to go now.
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,The group reach a clearing and is greeted by a lion-headed figure. She signals them to stop.
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Wait, that's Sekhmet the Powerful!"
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Halt! You must be the mortals Horus saw. Well met. Beyond this point you may reunite with your guide.
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Guide? But Faiez is back there at the pools. And um, what was his — Jarif? He can't be here, can he?"
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Hmm? Amongst mortals she goes by many names and forms. But those two I have never heard.
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Hey, maybe this is the guide Bennu mentioned! We thought it was Jarif, but maybe it was someone else?"
story.season.s5_province_26.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"Riddles... Enjoy those with the sphinxes. I seek to test your strength, not your wit. Raise your weapons!"
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Superb. All of you look well prepared for the task ahead. Especially you, from the nearby village."
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,There's a village here? And who?... oh. That does explain why you knew this area so well! Mystery solved.
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Look, I was only born there. I haven't been there since forever. My loyalty is to the people of Kemyth."
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Hold up, I don't follow. So there's a village here... but it isn't a part of Kemyth?"
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Yes and no. It's not really a village, more like a hideout. And its people deeply resent the current royals."
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Very few outsiders know of it, and it'd be best if it stays that way. I trust you two won't breathe a word."
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"I can certainly guess as to why. No need for needless bloodshed. Don't worry, the secret's safe with us."
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"And knowing this won't change our view of you at all! You know, just in case you were wondering."
story.season.s5_province_26.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Touching. But you do not have time to dally. Mortals, proceed. If all goes well, we will meet again soon."
story.season.s5_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Greetings!
story.season.s5_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Hello. Are you supposed to be our guide?
story.season.s5_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Wait... This is the cat that led all the scarabs away from me when I was crossing the oasis area alone.
story.season.s5_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Hey — THIS IS THAT CAT! FROM THE TOMBS!
story.season.s5_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Correct! But I do have a name for this form? And for a mortal, you're quite loud!"
story.season.s5_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Please forgive him, he's always like this. Could you tell us your name, if you don't mind us asking?"
story.season.s5_province_27.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Maybe? If you entertain me for a bit. Catch me if you can!
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"You're a bit too fast for us, Bastet..."
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Delightful! That was a fun tussle. But I wasn't being very fast! I think you're just a bit slow!
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Anyway. Now for more pressing matters! Have you outlanders heard of Set?
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Yes, we've given them a brief rundown. And Horus the Great, among others, have spoken of Set to us."
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Good! So Set despises the current ruler, who shuns him and only worships Horus. Set finds it insulting!"
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Ptolemy — Set wants to replace him with a past pharaoh, one from a bloodline that respected him!"
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"That sounds a bit petty, to be honest."
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Ahhotep! She was Set's first choice. You stopped her, so now other royal mummies are being prepared!"
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,So Set's dragging back their souls from the afterlife and using them against their will? That's horrible!
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Indeed. But many gods tend to do improper things when they feel slighted. Quite unseemly!
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,I think we've seen a few examples of that in other worlds we've been to...
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,"Well, we should hurry to that secluded pyramid. Maybe we could stop Set from raising another pharaoh."
story.season.s5_province_27.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,Unlikely! But that pyramid should still remain your destination. Off you go now — head straight south!
story.season.s5_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"As much as I'm critical about the state of the empire, what Set's trying to do is unthinkable."
story.season.s5_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I don't think even the Pharaoh's worst enemies would prefer to be ruled by an undead mummy pharaoh.
story.season.s5_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Well... I'm not sure about that. You may be surprised.
story.season.s5_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I'm not sure if I completely got what Bastet told us. Why did Kemyth's older rulers worship a god like Set?
story.season.s5_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Jarif once told me that in ancient times, Set used to be worshipped as a protector, like Horus the Great."
story.season.s5_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Also, even now, some areas quietly continue to worship Set. I may or may not know of one such place..."
story.season.s5_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Honestly, I don't think we'll ever be able to understand what gods do, or why. It's all far beyond us mortals."
story.season.s5_province_28.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"But right now, Horus is protecting us while Set's apparently seeking to harm us. That's all I need to know."
story.season.s5_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,You again? Are you allied with Set?
story.season.s5_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Silence! Dare not utter his name with your filthy mortal tongue.
story.season.s5_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Is it true he's trying to bring back another ancient pharaoh? Back from the dead?
story.season.s5_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Riffraff — your utter ignorance blinds you. Do you fools not see what this land needs?
story.season.s5_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Less gods like you?
story.season.s5_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Your sand golems really aren't that durable. Have you thought of using some other material?
story.season.s5_province_28.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,INSOLENCE! Sobek will soon hunt you down. Go pick out a dune you'd prefer to be buried under.
story.season.s5_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Was Papyros also originally a friendly god? Is he under some evil influence?
story.season.s5_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"I have no idea at all, to be honest — I couldn't recognize his name or appearance."
story.season.s5_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Neither could I. Then again, we've never really known how many gods there are in Kemyth."
story.season.s5_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"True. Maybe Jarif might have known something, though."
story.season.s5_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Or maybe Papyros wasn't a god at all! Could he just have been a very capable underling?
story.season.s5_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,If so — of who?
story.season.s5_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,SALUTATIONS!
story.season.s5_province_29.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Hey, it's Mr. Crocodile!"
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"AH! Marvelous as expected. And hammer boy, you should join my crew!"
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Eh... you seem cool and I'm always up for a good brawl, but helping Set? That doesn't sit right with me."
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Hmm? Is he not causing a glorious mayhem? This land hasn't been this restless in ages! It's delightful!
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,If I may offer a word — Set has only been wreaking havoc by warping other beings' minds.
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"He may have his reasons, but not once has he led his minions himself from the front lines."
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Well said. I do not believe such behavior befits the support of a truly powerful deity such as yourself!
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"A genuinely fearless god like Sobek would not resort to such roundabout, conniving methods."
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Hmm! You mortals DO understand my power and glory well! I shall give your pleas some consideration.
story.season.s5_province_29.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,I knew you'd understand!
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"I didn't expect Sobek to be that agreeable! Hey, maybe Set could be talked out of his plans too!"
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"That approach did work before, like back when we ran into Bennu and El Naddaha..."
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I don't expect much to come out of that, unfortunately. Set is nothing like the gods we've met."
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"A chilling gust of wind, somehow also laced with scorching grains of sand, blows from behind the group."
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Correct. How —
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Set! The enemy is here. Ready your weapons!
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"...impudent. Dare interrupt me again, mortal, and you will be taught anew the meaning of pain."
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Heroes! This land has long yearned for a reckoning. Do not let those brainwashed vermin fool you.
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Justice. Order. Surely these are the values you champion? If so, you three are more than welcome to join me."
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"No, we know all about what you've been up to. We're here to stop you."
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Confused? That can be remedied. I am here to save this land from its misery. Do you not wish the same?
story.season.s5_province_30.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,I don't think talking with this guy will achieve much!
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Are you really doing all this out of spite? Just because you're not being worshipped enough?
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Disappointing. Critical thinking is clearly not your forte. I shall kindly indulge your ignorance.
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Answer. Do the people of this land look happy with their ruler? Is their kingdom being managed well?
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Well, not exactly..."
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Good. Do you not agree that a poor, helpless ruler should be replaced by an experienced and capable one?"
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"In principle, yes, but —"
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Good. That is enough. In time, we will meet again. I shall grant you one more chance to submit then."
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Refuse... and I will then consider you equal to these blind fools who have been contaminating your mind.
story.season.s5_province_30.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Children — class dismissed. Carry on now with your little adventure, if you wish. What you do matters not."
story.season.s5_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Hey gang, you all look a bit downbeat. Something on your mind?"
story.season.s5_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Well... It's what Set said. I'm still convinced we must stop him. But I can't help but wonder...
story.season.s5_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"...whether he had a point, despite his methods of madness?"
story.season.s5_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Yeah. Records say Pharaoh Ahhotep was one of Kemyth's greatest rulers, right? We've all heard that."
story.season.s5_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Despite my grumblings, I will still defend the Pharaoh to my death against any threat to his rule or life."
story.season.s5_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,But if a wiser Pharaoh could rule again — would not a bloodless abdication be within reason?...
story.season.s5_province_31.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Ugh. I don't know how to answer that. It really isn't something we'd ever had a reason to think about before.
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Greetings. You have done well to make it this far.
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Eset the Wise!
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Welcome. Judging by your faces, you have already run into Set. Did our little workout help clear your minds?"
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Our commitment to defeating him remains steadfast. But the seeds of doubt he has planted among us...
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"I can only speak for myself, but they're still there, festering."
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Understandable. Worry not. On the road to the secluded pyramid lies a tomb. Take care to pay it a visit.
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Danger lies inside, and what you see may disgust you — but the sight should help you see more clearly."
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Agreed! And chin up! I do not doubt you mortals will prevail!
story.season.s5_province_31.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,BASTET! Where have you been all this time?
story.season.s5_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The group enter the tomb Eset mentioned and find it swarming with mummies.
story.season.s5_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Eset was right! This looks dangerous, and I already am a bit disgusted."
story.season.s5_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,It's quite a sight for sure... but I wouldn't be surprised if there's something worse ahead.
story.season.s5_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"At the very least, I don't think all these mummies would be here without a leader of some sort."
story.season.s5_province_32.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Agreed. Let's proceed with caution.
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Well done, children. But now you see how futile your resistance is."
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,How does it feel to fight against what is already dead? Would you like to try again?
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Their insolence warrants PUNISHMENT! How DARE you filth inconvenience Kemyth's true owners?
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Hush, dearest. This is but a brief delay. These fools cannot stop the inevitable."
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,All the other mummies here are clearly not of sound mind. Weren't they your former subjects?
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Indeed! Long ago, all of them swore to serve us in life and in death. Bless their loyalty!"
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Loyal? Or brainwashed? They don't seem to have any intelligence or agency. What have you done?
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Watch your words, scum. Or don't — it matters not. Soon you will have no use for your tongue."
story.season.s5_province_32.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Or no tongue at all! But don't let them goad you, dear. Let them chatter on their way out."
story.season.s5_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The group finally reach and enter the secluded pyramid.
story.season.s5_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"So many mummies... I thought we saw a lot in those tombs, but there's even more here."
story.season.s5_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"There must be something up here, just as Pharaoh Ptolemy suspected."
story.season.s5_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I truly hope it's not another set of deranged former pharaohs like the two we just saw.
story.season.s5_province_33.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,No time to waste. Let's get to the bottom of this. For Kemyth!
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Ma'at shakes her head from side to side, blinking slowly as if awoken from a long stupor."
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Ugh... Where is this? Who are you mortals? Was there some kind of battle here just now?
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Honorable Ma'at, we are blessed to be in your presence. We're in the secluded pyramid east of Caiza."
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Until just ago, you seemed to be under some malign influence, just like a few other gods we've met."
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,We're from the port area. These heroes here are from a faraway land who've been helping us stop Set.
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Hmm... ah, it's all starting to come back. I was lured here and trapped by Set. But after that... not much."
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Humiliating. I had assumed he might have finally changed his ways... Thank you for your aid, mortals."
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Your being sealed here explains much — the absence of order has been sorely felt in Kemyth as of late.
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Distressful. My resumed presence will soon tip the scales back a bit. But the fount of this chaos is Set.
story.season.s5_province_33.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"On that matter, all the deities we've met so far seem to be aligned. We will do our best to stop him."
story.season.s5_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Having freed Ma'at, the group exit the secluded pyramid."
story.season.s5_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,So... where to next? I don't think we've received any directions beyond this pyramid.
story.season.s5_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I've never ventured beyond this point either. It might not be wise to just blindly head forward...
story.season.s5_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Salutations! Worry not, your guide is back. Once again you must head east! I shall lead you."
story.season.s5_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Bastet! You always seem to be around wherever we go.
story.season.s5_province_34.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Indeed! But this arrangement will end soon. This is the homestretch. Your journey's end draws near.
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Splendid. You mortals look more than ready to put up a challenge against Set.
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,That's our plan. But we're also not sure how to take out those reawakened mummy pharaohs.
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Ah — of that, you need not worry. If Set can be properly pinned down, they may be freed."
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Respite — let us grant it to those poor souls, who are not acting of their own volition."
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"That sounds absolutely horrible... dragged back from the afterlife, just to be used against one's will."
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"I'm just relieved to hear that those pharaohs are just under some spell, and not actually that crazy."
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,And who on earth would really want to be ruled over by an undead mummy?
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"Rulership... Mortals always fight over its forms and exercisers, despite all of them being deeply flawed."
story.season.s5_province_34.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Yet even so, they must be allowed to choose their own poison. What Set is doing is unacceptable."
story.season.s5_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Is it only me, or has the air suddenly gotten a bit... heavy? Cold? I don't know how to put it."
story.season.s5_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I know what you mean — it started a while ago. A kind of chill... it feels very off. I don't like this.
story.season.s5_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Perceptive! We are indeed now very near Set's fortress of evil. But surely you're not turning back now?
story.season.s5_province_35.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Of course not.
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Excellent. Your display of strength assures me that you are well prepared for the task at hand.
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Yet — the challenge will still be monumental. Most of Set's forces are garrisoned in the pyramid ahead.
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Tremble! For a veritable ocean of enemies await!
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Indeed. Only by wading through that army will you reach Set and his... undead pharaoh generals.
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Despair! For the going will surely be arduous beyond belief!
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Bastet...
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Hmm? Just trying to cheer these mortals up with a little pep talk!
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,We will proceed no matter what lies ahead. We cannot rest until peace is brought to Kemyth.
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"See — it works! Well, now that that's settled, I shall leave to attend to some new urgent matters."
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"Wait, you're leaving?"
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Relax! I am sure you will fare fine by yourselves for a little while.
story.season.s5_province_35.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,"Agreed. Mortals — we may meet again sooner than you expect. Until then, best of luck."
story.season.s5_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Those filth are finally here. Let us prepare to greet them. Revenge shall be delicious.
story.season.s5_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"A bit optimistic, dear. We need to first see if the vermin even manage to reach us here."
story.season.s5_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Surely there's no need to gut our future subjects? Would they not be of good use once reformed?
story.season.s5_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Insolence is a frightful disease, Ahmose. Best to stamp it out lest any useful servant catches it."
story.season.s5_province_36.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,That I can agree with. I do look forward to judging them with my own eyes soon...
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,CURSES!
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,At this point I'm not sure whether we can actually take these mummies down. They don't stay down.
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,And we're still yet to see Set. Anubis said he'd be here...
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Let's not let our guard down. Vivica, any ideas?"
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,I think —
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Welcome! Mortals, I have eagerly expected your arrival. Have you given my offer some thought?"
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Hardly, but it was about time you showed your face instead of hiding behind your underlings."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Shame. I offer you a better world, and you instead wish to die in vain."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Ha! I shall gladly fulfill your desire!
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"Looks like we'll have to settle this once and for all, then. Friends, let's give it everything we've got!"
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Are we sure we can take him? He's looking far more forbidding than last time...
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"Suddenly, a throng of familiar faces join the scene."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,What!?
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Heroes ─ worry not! You won't be fighting alone.
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,"We, the gods of Kemyth, shall be giving you our aid!"
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Mortals! You have done well, as we knew you would."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Anubis! Eset! Let us grant these poor souls some peace. I'll keep this rogue occupied.
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Anubis —
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Understood.
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"The two gods start freeing the mummies' souls. One by one, Ahhotep, Tetisheri, and Ahmose stop moving."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Good. In due time, the rest of the mummies should also become unchained from this fiend's mind."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"Set — your feud with Horus may not be our business, but your antics have truly crossed the line this time."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,No...
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,NO!!!
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Congratulations! I see everything all worked out and everyone played a part! Delightful!
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"Bastet — thank you for your coordinating efforts. Peace has been restored to this land... for now, at least."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,Indeed. And may all the long-past-dead dragged out of the field of reeds swiftly return to their repose.
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,"We cannot thank you enough, heroes. Kemyth is forever in your debt! Your names will go down in history."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,"All the damage Set has wrought won't disappear overnight, though..."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,"Yes. Unfortunately, we still may be in some need of your strength."
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,We'll return to this world for as long and as many times it takes. It wouldn't be the first time we've done so.
story.season.s5_province_36.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,Let's head back to Caiza to deliver the good news! This occasion calls for the absolute grandest of feasts!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Welcome all to the Kingdom of Atlantis!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00_choice_02,"""I'm not making a choice"""
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Another cycle of the waves has gone and here we are to raise our tridents yet again.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01_choice_00,"""I like Choice A."""
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01_choice_01,"""Choice B is clearly superior!"""
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,To celebrate Atlantis!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Let the Atlantean Games begin!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Crowd roars in celebration.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,It seems like the entire 7 seas have gathered here.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Thank you for accepting my invitation.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,This is one of the most important days for all sea-kind.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Tell me about the Atlantean Games.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,What do we actually do as participants?
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,We fight for the glory of Atlantis!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Sounds like your kind of competition Richard.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,"Be careful, Lasalle is the reigning champion."
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Really? He looks like he can barely swing a sword!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Let's go!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00_choice_00_result,This is the result of choice A
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.0.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00_choice_01_result,This is the result of choice B
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.18.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,What was up with these guys!?
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.18.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,There was something familiar about them.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.18.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"True, there's something not quite right here."
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.18.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,They reminded me of the minions of Ursena.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.18.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,What did you say?
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.18.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"No time to explain, they're fleeing into deeper waters!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.18.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Follow them!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,This can't be...
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,This for certain doesn't look good.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,These Jhag'r are incredible!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Usually they are very weak.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,That's because they are being strengthened by a dark power.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,A dark power we defeated.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,How come there are still remnants of Ursena's corruption?
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"I don't know, but we must warn Ariel and Poseidon about this."
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I can't believe how you can swing that hammer with such might under the sea.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I have had some practice! Bwahaha!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Congratulations! I wouldn't expect any less from the heroes that saved Atlantis.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,They defeated Ursena?
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,That explains everything!
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Richard laughs, patting his flexed bicep."
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,"We didn't do it alone, we had a lot of help on the way."
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,You banished the threat to Atlantis.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,A threat even I fell victim to.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Some commotion is heard outside.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,What is going on here?
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,The Jhag'r fish-people of Ifaísteio seem to be causing mayhem outside the palace.
story.season.tales1_chapter_01.9.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,We better investigate.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Our heroes are back in Atlantis
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,What did you learn?
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,It's worse than we thought.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,The corruption left by Ursena remains.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Ursena is not behind the corruption that lingers, my young friends."
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Ah, Galapago! Do you know more of this?"
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"I believe I do, your majesty. I did study the corruption after the defeat of Ursena."
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,This is a whole new evil that is influencing our realm from the darkest depths.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Then we must stop it in its tracks!
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"Yes, we should start by going to the deepest trenches below Atlantis near where Ursena used to be imprisoned."
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,No time to waste!
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"Good luck, brave heroes!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Wow! I've never been this deep below Atlantis before.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,This whole place is overrun by corruption.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,The magic Poseidon used to imprison Ursena was very powerful.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,The dark influence from the depths must have weakened the magic seal.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,So there was another powerful evil helping Ursena?
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,If that is true... Yikes!
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I'm not sure.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,We should investigate deeper!
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Hey! I found something.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"It's an ancient artifact, let me have a look."
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,There are many mysteries in the deep that even I don't know about.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Yoink! That will be mine now.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,No! That's ours!
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,The fish person swam away...
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Let's go after him!
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Stop, thief!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Blargh! I am defeated.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,I'll be taking the artifact back thank you!
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I could have fetched a high price for that.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Let's have a look.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"Ah, hm..."
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,It seems to be a map to a temple hidden in the trench caverns.
story.season.tales1_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,I wonder if we'll find any treasures of the deep.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Looks like we have reached the temple.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"If I wasn't a valiant warrior, I would describe this area as creepy."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Careful, we're not the only ones here!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"It seems to be so, the entrance appears to be desecrated."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Stay on guard.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Someone there?!
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Watch out land dweller, this temple is old and full of danger..."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,It's too dark to see in here.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Do not worry child, I am the keeper of this temple."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,You seem sensible enough.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,We are investigating the corruption coming from the deep. This artifact showed us the way here.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Ah, very good. You must return the artifact to the heart of this temple."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"You see, this temple has been a barrier. It has kept the nightmares living in the darkest crevices of the deep far away from the surface."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"But ever since the artifact went missing, the corruption has been growing stronger."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Come... Follow me.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This temple is much larger than I anticipated.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,An aeon ago this temple used to house thousands of keepers like myself.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I had read stories of the existence of a temple such as this, but for a long time I believed it to be a mere legend."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Yes, my predecessors did safeguard knowledge of the location of this temple..."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Ultrox is gesturing the party to move forward.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Please, we are near the inner sanctum."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,This guy is giving me the creeps.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Tell me about it. Don't lower your guard.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We have arrived...
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Place the artifact on the pedestal.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I have a bad feeling about this.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"I don't know what other choice we have. If we turn back now, we are out of clues."
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Elena places the artifact on the pedestal. The room rumbles.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Good work.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Now rise... Empress.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Perish...
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,I am the true ruler of the seas...
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Ready your weapons!
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,How could you defeat the Empress?!
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Not the first time.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,You are the true enemy of the seas.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,You better start talking.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,...
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Ursena's memories flood Elena's mind.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Elena! Are you with us?
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,You will perish with this temple.
story.season.tales1_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,The temple rumbles and starts sinking deeper into the depths.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Our heroes are at the ruins of the now sunken temple.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Hey! Can anyone hear me?!
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Lasalle!
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Have you seen anyone else?
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,No. All I know is the temple sank and now we're stuck in this dark cavern.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Come, we have to find the others!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Richard! Lasalle! Over here!
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Glad to see you are safe. Where is Elena?
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Elena is right here.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,............
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,She has been unresponsive since the temple's collapse.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"It's still dangerous here, we should try finding some safety."
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Agreed.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This place is impossible to navigate.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"If I would make a scholarly guess, I'd say we are very close to the heart of the depths."
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I just wish it wasn't so dark in here!
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Maybe I could help you.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The thief!
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Calm down! I know we got started on the wrong foot.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,My intentions are sincere. I can help you get out of this crevice.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,It seems we have no choice. We are lost.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Follow me!
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Where am I?
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Elena! You're awake!
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Last thing I remember was fighting Ultrox.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,The temple sank and since then we have been lost in these caverns.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"I don't really understand why, but this place feels familiar."
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,What do you mean?
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,We need to go deeper.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,We would be entering the heart of darkness itself. I would advise against that.
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Trust me, I think I know how we can stop the corruption threatening Atlantis."
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"Ah, the thrill of adventure begins to stir my soul."
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"Jaco, light the way!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,Blargh.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The pressure of the deep begins to truly weigh heavy on us.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I'm not sure this is the way out.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"I don't know why, but this direction reminds me of..."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,...home.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Elena, are you sure you're alright?"
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I think so.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"We'd best keep moving forward, there is no reason to go back now. We will find a way to the surface soon enough."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Are we really getting closer to the surface?
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,It feels we have been in the deep for a long time.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I miss clear and sunny waters...
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Elena collapses
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Elena!
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"I'm alright, I'll just stand up."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,You're not looking too good.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,I can keep going!
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,We have almost reached home.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,What home?!
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Let me see...
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"Elena, your eye color seems to be changing."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,"Back off, we don't have time for this. Enemies approach!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,There's a vast city on the ocean floor.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I would never have imagined something so large to be hiding all the way down here.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Wow!
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,This is the Capital of the Deep.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The city...
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,It feels like it's calling to me...
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Were you leading us here all this time?
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,I believe something happened to Elena at the Temple.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Perhaps the answers lie in that very city.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,I hope there isn't a trap waiting for us down there.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"We have been fighting our way down to this abyss, but we still have no answers."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Someone powerful is close.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Visitors...
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I hope the welcome wasn't too rough.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Who are you?
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"I am Gestalt, Prince of the Deep."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Though you may not know of me, you have been battling me all this time."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,What do you mean?
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,All touched by the Deep share a connection that eventually transcends the individual.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,It's the same spells Ursena used to control Atlantis.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,I wouldn't call it a spell. It's a collective need to be part of something greater that binds the mind.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"In fact, one of you seems to have connected with a very powerful mind."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,...
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,"Ah, you!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Elena! Watch out!
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,"Elena, is it?"
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,I will smash your head in and break whatever spell you have cast on her!
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,We haven't even made a scratch on him...
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Hmph! I expected more from the ones who defeated my sister.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Elena, you are carrying the last remaining essence of Ursena."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"If you were to give in, you could hold tremendous power."
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,In fact you could join us in the creation of a whole new era.
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,...
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,She would never!
story.season.tales1_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"We shall see, soon enough."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We're finally in the palace of the deep.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,This is it! Time to break some heads.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Stay on your toes, we will be facing tremendous resistance."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,...
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Agh! My head...
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Elena has a flashback
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,You insolent fool.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,It is our birthright to usher in a new era.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,We would be all powerful as an entity of eternity.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"I am the Empress of the Depths, an immortal of the deep."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"I have no need for your fantasies, Gestalt."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,I wield ultimate power.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Even your power wanes as you have become complacent.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,I think you would succumb to the power of Domiventus within a blink of an eye.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,You do not speak of Domiventus!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Gestalt laughs mockingly
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,No... You wouldn't even be able to take on Poseidon of Atlantis at this point.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,I will have your tongue...
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Elena's flashback ends
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,"Our time is running out, Elena is losing herself."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,"Eventually, Gestalt challenged Ursena, forcing her to exile."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,Ursena believed if she took over Atlantis she could gain enough power to challenge Gestalt.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_18,It does seem if we leave Gestalt unchecked he will use his power to slowly consume everything.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_19,I saw a mention of a being called Domiventus in the memory.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_20,"We should not speak here, let's keep moving on."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,What is Domiventus?
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Domiventus is a supreme being of an archaic cult.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,The worshippers of Domiventus would attempt to cut all chains of consciousness to become a part of Domiventus.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Scholars have never taken the legends of Domiventus seriously, but not many scholars have spent time in the deep."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"So, it could be true?"
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,It is true. Summoning Domiventus is Gestalt's end goal.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Ursena wanted to defeat Gestalt because she feared the power Gestalt was channeling into this world.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"At first, she was imprisoned by Poseidon when she tried to take over Atlantis."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"But as Gestalt's power and influence grew in the deep, so did Ursena's, allowing her to break free and subjugate Atlantis along with Poseidon."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,How do you know all this?
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Elena has unlocked the rest of Ursena's memories.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,This means that it will not be long before Ursena's memories devour her mind.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,I can hold on a little while longer.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,We must stop Gestalt.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,O Great Prince! I wish to inform you that the summoning has finally begun.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"After all these millennia, the moment of time converging into timelessness is nearing."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,The heroes break into the innermost sanctum.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Ah! Elena, have you made your decision?"
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Yes, I have."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I do hope you have chosen to assimilate with the memories of my dear sister.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,You see...
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,There is only one path to perfection and that is for all the actors in this universe to become of single mind.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Sharing a mind with Ursena, you are peering into this new era firsthand."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,It is magnificent.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Wouldn't you agree, Elena?"
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,I will not allow you to take control of my mind using Ursena's memories.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,We are here to stop your madness!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Our friends and companions are the ones who make us who we are!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,For the freedom to learn of the mysteries of this world.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,For lots of gold!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,For Atlantis!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,"We all have our individual reasons, but we will fight you as one!"
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_18,No one truly receives the credit when they have overcome both the world and themselves.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_19,So be it... Show me your resolve.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,It's over...
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,"Elena, how are you feeling?"
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"I feel more clearheaded, I think that did the trick."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Fantastic!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Friends, it's finally time to return back to Atlantis."
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,Later in Atlantis
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Brave champions! You have once again done an immeasurable service to Atlantis.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,We are truly in your debt.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,I never would have believed that a whole different world existed below Atlantis.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,We uncovered the mysteries of the deep.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Mysteries that were believed to be merely legend. This adventure was a treasure trove of knowledge.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,We also defeated a world devouring eternal being.
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,That was beyond awesome!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,Indeed Lasalle!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,"What I'm wondering is, who became the new leader of the Deep?"
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,... about that ...
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,Meanwhile in the Capital of the Deep
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,Blargh!
story.season.tales1_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,The End
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Friends, you came!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Is Yggdrasil under threat?
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Oooh no no! Everything is fine here in Asgard.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Actually there is someone I would like you to meet.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Pleased to meet the heroes that once saved the Nine Realms.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"This is Regin, a dwarf from Nidavellir."
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Pleased to make your acquaintance, how can we help you?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,There is a small familial squabble that I could use your help in.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"We're having issues with my father, my brother and I."
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,What kind of issues?
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Our father wants to disown us and keep his riches to himself.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,And how can we help with that?
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,You see.. We want you to steal Regin's father's gold.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,You are daring and perfect for the job I think.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,"I know it sounds dastardly, but I assure you that it is for a good cause."
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,My father has been hoarding this gold for hundreds of years. I would like to use this gold to help the citizens of Nidavellir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,This sounds like an adventure!
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,I knew you were right for the job.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This way to Nidavellir!
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I have never heard of Nidavellir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I'm not surprised. Not many have...
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"There are two hidden realms between Svartalfheim and the glaciers of Niflheim. I live in Nidavellir, a land as burning hot as Muspelheim –if not even hotter."
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Then there is Myrkheim, a land rich in gold but frozen akin to Niflheim. Even though Myrkheim is dwarven land, not many of us spend time there other than to mine gold and minerals."
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Fascinating!
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I can't wait to see it with my own eyes.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,The roads here are perilous.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,And even though we're not in Nidavellir yet all manner of fiery creatures roam these plains.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,It's one reason why we don't get many travelers visiting dwarven lands.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Also, the lava fields we have tend to be deadly for most beings from other realms."
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,It's easier for us to visit Asgard to do business.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,How will we manage in Nidavellir if it is as hot as you say?
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Oh, don't worry! I know how to keep you safe."
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Curse you Regin! This is not the last time we fight.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,She doesn't seem to like you.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Andvari will come around... She just blames me for losing her magic ring.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Did you have anything to do with that?
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Only by association, I only showed the ring to Loki. It was Loki's idea to use magic to turn Andvari into a pike and..."
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,So Loki took the ring?
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Hey! If you ask me... It was Andvari who lost the ring in the river.
story.season.tales2_chapter_01.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,But enough about that! Nidavellir is right beyond that hill.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Regin, could you tell me more about Andvari's ring?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,What do you want to know?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"If Andvari desires the ring's return, it must be powerful."
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,It sure is!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,The ring is called Andvaranaut.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Anyone who wields it is promised great wealth.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Alchemy... Transmutation magic?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,The power to turn lead into gold?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Nah... Nothing so fancy.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,The Andvaranaut allows the wielder to read the market.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Clairvoyance!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Imagine! You could become as wealthy as a king just by trading turnips.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Incredible.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Regin! Father wants you to come back home.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Oh! It's you, Ott..."
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Regin...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,This whole rebel act is unbecoming of you.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,We were cast aside by father.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I'm not going to grovel at his feet for his affection like you and Fafnir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Brothers should stick together!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,But I will not stay my hand if you won't listen to reason.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,So be it...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I should have known I can't defeat you...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,...but I can slow you down!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,We will meet again!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Hey!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,He ran off.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,You don't seem to be very popular around here.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,It comes with the territory when you're a handsome rogue.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,I suppose so.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,We shouldn't dally here.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,My father's gold is waiting!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We have ventured far into the lava fields.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,The heat is becoming unbearable.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Don't worry! It won't get much worse than this.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,This is the safest road for outsiders.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,How are the people of Nidavellir able to withstand these scalding temperatures?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,We have enhanced our hearts with Core technology.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Impossible!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,I've studied magical constructs that are powered by Cores.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,How have you managed to harness such mystical technology?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,We are master craftsmen and well-versed in all magical technologies.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,You absolutely have to share your notes with me.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Sorry...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,These are super secret trade secrets...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,...so if anyone asks you didn't get this tome of super secret knowledge from me.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.20.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,I can't contain my excitement!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I demand you return my ring to me!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Andvari, my friend!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Just the person I wanted to see.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Do not joke with me Regin.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Either you return my ring at once or offer equivalent compensation!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,What would be “equivalent compensation”?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Hm...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,One-million gold coins!
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,I wouldn't be able to make that money in a thousand lifetimes...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,...and as a Nidavellian my lifetime is already really long to begin with.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Then pay with your life, you scoundrel!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Haven't you had enough, Andvari?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Get off me you thug.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,We used to be such good friends...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,You shouldn't let a misunderstanding get in the way of a beautiful friendship.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"We are not friends, Regin."
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I will file a formal complaint to the King himself.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,The King will sort you out.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Bah...
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,If anything my father would demand Andvari's ring for himself.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,How long until we reach Nidavellir?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,We are almost at the gates.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,Once we get there we should sneak in and try not to get caught.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,Do you have a plan?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,The plan will make itself as we get there.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,Are you sure?
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,I know the city gates like the back of my hand.
story.season.tales2_chapter_02.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,Trust me!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Look! We are almost at the vaults of my father.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,That was simpler than I thought.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I was sure we were going to get caught sneaking past the main gate.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,We slipped right through under their noses.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Regin, you are more resourceful than I gave you credit for at the beginning."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Hey!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Who are you?!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Uh-oh...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,You're not supposed to be in here!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,There goes the element of surprise...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,I guess we are fighting our way to the gold then.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,If we're fast we can still make it in and out with the gold before my father's guard can muster their defenses.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.0.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Let's move!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Brother! Don't do this.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Ott, we don't have to fight."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,You could just let me go through and we pretend we didn't see each other.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,If you leave now we can do that.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,You just have to go before our younger brother arrives.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,I can't turn back.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I am determined to get my father's gold.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Doesn't matter who gets in my way.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Ott!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Fafnir...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Good work, Ott. You found the intruder."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"Regin, you're my older brother."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,Shouldn't you be setting a better example?
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,I know you're after father's gold the same way I am.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Lies!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,Ott! Aethslegaur! Seize this miscreant at once.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.11.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,"Yes, master."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,I think we lost them.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,We are surrounded by formidable adversaries.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Yep!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Regin, what's the plan?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,Fafnir is dangerous. We best avoid him at all costs.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,There's a secret passage to the vault nearby.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,It's our best bet now that the kingdom is on high alert.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Do the guards know of the secret passage?
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,I don't think so.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,I doubt even my father knows about it.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,We used to play as kids there with Ott.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,Would Ott expect you to use the secret passage?
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,I hope it doesn't occur to him.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,We are wasting time here.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.16.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,"We don't have a choice, we must move now!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,That was surprisingly simple!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I knew the secret passage was the right choice.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,So are these the vaults?
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Looks more like a maze full of narrow passageways.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Yes, the Nidavellian gold vaults are an extensive network of tunnels."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Very classical dwarven innovation and design, even if I say so myself."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Now! Let's take this left turn and...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Ooof!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Hey!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Ouch...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Watch where you're going!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,"Andvari, what are you of all people doing here?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,And...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,...father...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,"Regin, I am disappointed in you."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,I always had such high expectations for your future.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,"Father, what I'm doing is for the greater good of Nidavellir!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.17.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_18,I'll have to stop your foolish ambitions for my gold here.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"There is nowhere to run anymore, Regin."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Your covetous plan ends here.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,We are surrounded.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Stand down, outsiders."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,We will let you return to your kingdom if you surrender.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"We got this far, might as well fight and nab the gold during our daring escape."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,"Right, Regin?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,You're right!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Father! I will show you the truth.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"Fafnir, seize them."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,Fafnir!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Why aren't you doing anything?
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,This is our chance!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,The gold and treasure of Nidavellir...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,...all of it...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,All of it is mine! And mine alone!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Father...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Listen, your people are suffering."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,We need to use some of the gold to aid those in need.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,The gold is mine...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Enough of this charade.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,"Aethslegaur, strike my father down."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Haa!!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Urgh!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,Father!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,He was a fool.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,I will take the gold now.
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,"Aethslegaur, gather our forces. We're leaving for my palace in Myrkheim."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,"At once, master."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,King Hreidmarr...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,"...the king is wounded, but I believe I can heal him."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,Thank goodness!
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_19,"You are a true friend, Andvari."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_20,We are not friends...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_21,Heh...
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_22,"Whatever you say, Andvari."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_23,"Please, take care of my father. I am going to pursue Fafnir."
story.season.tales2_chapter_03.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_24,"Myrkheim, here we come!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Ah! The air is fresh and the wind blows free!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,A nice change of scenery to the heat of Nidavellir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Welcome to Myrkheim!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,"Enjoy it while it lasts, it's going to get dark soon and the temperature will plummet."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,It's already oppressively cold in my opinion.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,We should seek warmth and shelter.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,There should be a camp for Myrkheim explorers nearby.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Let's start by going there!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,We made it!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,This is a great opportunity to gather supplies before we set off deeper into Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,"Good idea, the icy wastelands of Myrkheim are a harsh host for visitors. It's good to be prepared."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Do you know where Fafnir's palace is located?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Sadly, I don't..."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,...but I know someone who does.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Who would that be?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,"If there is someone who knows Myrkheim, it would definitely be Snorri the Storyteller."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.10.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,We shall set out to find him in the morning!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Stop!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,State your business in Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,We are searching for Snorri.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,I've heard he lives around these parts.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,There is no Snorri here.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Begone!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Aren't these the guys who have been attacking us since we arrived in Myrkheim?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,They do seem familiar.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Why are you following us?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,That doesn't concern you.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,We will not allow you to proceed.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.16.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Prepare yourselves!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Snorri?!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Anyone here?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Who goes there?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"It is I, Regin Hreidmarsson of Nidavellir."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I am looking for Snorri the Storyteller.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,Well well...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,I haven't had royal visitors since the first sagas were sung.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,How can I help you?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,King Hreidmarr was betrayed by Fafnir and we're in his pursuit.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Regin told us that you know where his palace is located.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,I know many things about Myrkheim...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,...but I can't help you with your request.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,All I can say is that Fafnir's palace lies in the heart of Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,Deep within the ground from where the cold flows and envelops the land.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,There has to be a way to get there.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,Is there anything you know that could help us on our journey?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,"I am sorry, young one."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,Are you sure?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_19,You would gain something invaluable from helping us...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_20,What are you talking about?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_21,"Stories, my friend!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_22,By helping us you could gain another amazing story to tell.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_23,That is an interesting proposition...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_24,I can take you to the heart of Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.20.onlevelcompleted.dialog_25,You won't regret it!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"Finally I found you, Regin!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,"Ott, what are you doing in Myrkheim?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"On second thought, I don't have time for this."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Of course you don't!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,You attacked our father and stole his gold...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"...so, are you happy now?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Do I look like I'm swimming in bling to you?
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,I'm half frozen and my boots are wet.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,"Besides, it was Fafnir who attacked father and took the gold."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,You're lying!
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,I will drag you back to Nidavellir to face justice.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,"Listen to me, Ott."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,We are traveling towards the heart of Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Fafnir betrayed us all.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,I only wanted to steal father's gold.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,I never wanted to hurt father despite our differences.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,"I want to believe you, Regin."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,It's just difficult...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,..Fafnir...
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,"Ott, you could help us."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"Myrkheim is treacherous, cold and dark."
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,We could use all the help we can get.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,I will join you.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,I need to speak with Fafnir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_04.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,"Glad to have you with us, brother."
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,This frozen gorge will lead us to the uncharted parts of Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,What thirst for danger would drive anyone to explore these lands... I don't know.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,"Someone explored this borderland alright! And on top of that, built a fortress in its heart."
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,We will find that fortress and return your father's gold to the people of Nidavellir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Thank you, my friends!"
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,You have my deepest gratitude for sticking with me all this way.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Everyone! Over here.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,There seems to be a safe path this way.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Let's hurry!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I have never been this far in Myrkheim ever.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Icy corridor after icy corridor...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,It feels like a maze.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,A perfect place to hide with a stash of stolen gold.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Did Fafnir plan to betray father all along?
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Perhaps...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I've just been thinking about all of this.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Why would Fafnir build his palace in the most remote area of Myrkheim?
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,I would much rather settle somewhere closer to Nidavellir...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,...unless there was a reason not to.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,Exactly!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Let's continue our chat later.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,There's enemies up ahead!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,There they are!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,This is as far as you will go.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,By decree of King Fafnir...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,...the usurper known as Regin and his band of brigands are ordered to surrender immediately.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,Fafnir is no king!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Hreidmarr is still the king of Myrkheim and Nidavellir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Without his gold Hreidmarr holds no authority.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,That's right!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,So surrender now and bend the knee to the true king.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Maybe he will be merciful as you are his brother.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,I will do no such thing.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Prepare yourselves!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,"This is your final chance to surrender, Regin."
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,I have a message for Fafnir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,You can tell him to kiss that gold goodbye.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,You try our patience...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,"Thrívaldi, let's be done with this honorless whelp."
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,Aethslegaur!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,You were part of the royal guard and betrayed your own king.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,You have no right to speak of honor.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Hmph...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,...Hreidmarr was a weak king...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,So it was you who attacked father!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,If you do not surrender...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,...then perish!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,They're running away with their tails between their legs!
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,If we follow them they will most likely lead us to Fafnir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,Great! We will finally finish this.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,"Regin, I wish to apologize for believing you were the one to attack our father."
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Even though I'm the oldest of us brothers, I always looked up to Fafnir."
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,He was always so dependable...
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,...I always thought that if I could be more like Fafnir then father would take me seriously.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Father was always conceited.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,All he truly cared about was his gold.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,He had no space in his heart for his sons.
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,"That may be true, but he still remains dear to me."
story.season.tales2_chapter_05.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,...I care for him too.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Is this Fafnir's palace?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,It must be...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,I can't believe a place like this existed in Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,This place reeks of a curse most foul.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,It feels like a mistake to have come here.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,We shouldn't linger.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,"Regin, what's the plan?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Let's create a diversion and face Fafnir while his men are distracted.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,What if we can't catch Fafnir by surprise?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,Well...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,We improvise!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Improvise?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,"In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity. The Art of War."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,I'm sure we will land on our feet no matter what happens.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Haha!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,"As cool as a cucumber in the face of danger as always, Regin."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.0.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,Let's go find my brother!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,We haven't been fully discovered yet.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,This is good.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Shh!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Hide! Someone's coming...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,I heard there's been an intruder.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Yes, Regin and his gang of rogues have snuck into the palace."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,So my brother followed me all the way here...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,Find him and bring him to me!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,I don't care what you do with the rest.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"At once, my lord."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,I think they're gone now.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,There is something wrong with Fafnir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,I felt it just now...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,I felt it too.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,Yes. You are right.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,The curse shrouding this palace is emanating from Fafnir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,We should be careful.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,It's time to enact the plan.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_18,"Snorri and Ott, can you two create a distraction while we follow Fafnir?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_19,We can do it!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.10.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_20,Alright! Let's follow Fafnir!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,Fafnir!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Regin!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Guards!? Where are they?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,Seems like Ott's distraction is working.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,This is our chance to capture Fafnir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,It makes no difference...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,I will defeat you myself.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,You're outnumbered.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,Just give up and return to Nidavellir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,"Brother, you should know your place."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,"You see, you have no chance against me."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,I have the Andvaranaut.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,Andvari's ring?!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,I thought Loki had it.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,I received it as a gift from Loki.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,What? Why would he do that?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_16,Loki believes it is time for a new king in Nidavellir and Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_17,Interesting...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_18,Does the ring contain some hidden power?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_19,The Andvaranaut is a mere trinket that makes the owner rich.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_20,It shouldn't have any other powers.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_21,Enough talk!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,What...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,...I can't be defeated so easily.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,It's time to return to Nidavellir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,Ugh.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,"Also, you can consider the riches you stole now forfeit."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,No...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,No!!!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,He crushed the ring in his hand!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,Something is happening!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Everyone get down!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,Gaaaaahh!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,I'll strike you down!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,Regin! Watch out!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,Uh oh! I can't dodge the attack...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,Stop Fafnir!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,Uwoooh!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,Ott!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,Ouch! That hurt.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,Pathetic...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_19,No one will take my gold.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_20,He just left?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_21,"Ott, are you alright?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_22,"It's just a bruise, I'll be fine."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_23,You saved me.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_24,It's no big deal.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_25,I finally saw Fafnir's true colors.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_26,I couldn't allow him to hurt my brother.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_27,...Thank you.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_28,I felt an immense amount of cursed power.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_29,What happened?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_30,Fafnir transformed after crushing the Andvaranaut.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_31,This doesn't sound good.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_32,I'll stay here and take care of Ott.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_33,You need to stop Fafnir. This cursed corruption can't be allowed to spread from this palace.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_34,We are on it!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.19.onlevelcompleted.dialog_35,Let's put an end to this!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_00,I want you to amass our forces and prepare to march.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_01,Yes master.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_02,Once we take control of Nidavellir. We move for Midgard as soon as possible.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_03,As you command.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_04,It is finally time for King Fafnir to reign over all.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_05,"Now leave me, I will return to my riches."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_06,Stop right there!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_07,We are gonna put a stop to your plans.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_08,To protect the realms and our friends!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_09,You...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_10,You scum won't leave me alone!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_11,Aethslegaur...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_12,Thrívaldi...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_13,Destroy them!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_14,For all the people you have hurt...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelbuttonclick.dialog_15,I won't lose!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_00,Is it over?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_01,Fafnir has been defeated.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_02,...brother.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_03,What's that over there?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_04,It's the Andvaranaut.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_05,I'll be taking that.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_06,The cursed power is fading from the ring.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_07,Let's take the gold and return to Nidavellir.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_08,A few days later...
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_09,Did you have a thrilling adventure?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_10,For sure! Anything less would be an understatement.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_11,"Loki, why did you give the Andvaranaut to Fafnir?"
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_12,I am Loki the Trickster.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_13,I thought it would be exciting to see what happens.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_14,Fafnir almost launched an invasion on Midgard.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_15,I'm sure Thor and company would have done something if that were to happen.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_16,...But I wouldn't worry about that as it didn't happen.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_17,Until next time. Friends.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_18,Hahaha!
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_19,I finally caught up to you Regin.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_20,"Andvari, I have something for you. Take this."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_21,What?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_22,"...Wait, this is my ring."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_23,It's best the ring stays with you.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_24,Thank you.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_25,"Thank you, my friends."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_26,Peace has returned to Nidavellir and Myrkheim.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_27,I'm happy we were able to help.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_28,What are you going to do with the gold?
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_29,I will return to Nidavellir and with Ott we will use the gold to help our people.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_30,"Father is still recovering, so we will care for him."
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_31,Sounds like a new prosperous time for Nidavellir is about to begin.
story.season.tales2_chapter_06.27.onlevelcompleted.dialog_32,We will do our best!
